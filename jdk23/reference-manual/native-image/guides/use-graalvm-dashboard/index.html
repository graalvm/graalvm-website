<p>GraalVM Dashboard was removed in GraalVM for JDK 22.
Instead, use the <a href="/jdk23/reference-manual/native-image/overview/build-report/">Native Image Build Reports</a>.
The Native Image Build Reports provide useful visualizations and comprehensive insights into different metrics of your native executable and the build process itself.</p>
