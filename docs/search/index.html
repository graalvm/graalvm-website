          "content": "19.0.2(2019-06-13)This is a bug fix release for 19.0 and we recommend upgrading for all 19.0.x users.Java  Improved compilation performance of scheduler phase.  Support retrieving annotations from class initializers (see 1320).  Fixed problems related to the freetype library: 1269, 1270, 1305.  Fixed Version string reporting (it was missing 64-Bit in the string).Native image  Fixed IllegalArgumentException: Cannot create Method for class initializer (see 1320).  Fixed an issue when the build would loop forever if META-INF/native-image/native-image.properties contains --force-fallback.  Fixed the issue where fallback image generation would not respect the --no-server argument.  Fix native-image-agent=restrict configuration detection.  Added -agentlib:native-image-agent=build configuration option.LLVM interpreterAllow LLVM interpreter Context to run without allowIO(true).19.0.0(2019-05-09)Early Adopter Windows SupportThe early adopter builds for Windows are available for GraalVM. These includethe JDK with the GraalVM compiler enabled, the Native Image capabilities,GraalVM’s JavaScript engine and the developer tools: Chrome inspector baseddebugger, Profiler etc.. Currently there is no gu utility or the ability toadd support for the other GraalVM languages.Java  We updated the base JDK to 8u212. You can find the JDK release notes at the Oracle Technology Network website.Native ImageNative Image was extracted from the base GraalVM distribution. Currently it isavailable as an early adopter plugin. To install it, run: gu installnative-image. After this additional step, the native-image executable will bein the bin directory, as for the previous releases.There was a change in how classes are initialized in a native-image. Now, we initialize application classes at run time by default. The policy for initialization is as follows:  All JDK classes are initialized at build time.  We prove the safety of application static initializers after the analysis and initialize the safe classes.  We provide the following flags to control class initialization in a fine-grained way: --initialize-at-build-time and --initialize-at-run-time.The performance and startup impact of this change is negligible on all benchmarks that we have.This change was made to improve user experience: there is no need to writesubstitutions and to deal with instances of unsupported classes ending up in theimage heap. Their applications, given the right configuration for reflection,proxies, etc., should work without performance degradation.To allow framework authors and end users to keep the startup time at minimum weimproved functionality of --initialize-at-build-time and--initialize-at-run-time. These flags allow to specify a policy for wholepackages or individual classes. For example, if we have classes p.C1, p.C2,… , p.Cn, we can eagerly initialize this package with--initalize-at-build-time=p. If we want to delay one of the classes in packagep we can simply add --initialize-at-run-time=p.C1.The whole class hierarchy can be initialized at build time by simply passing --initalize-at-build-time on the command line.We also introduced the flag -H:+PrintClassInitialization which allows you to track what class initialization does during the image build. This flag will help you configure the build to work as intended.What should I do if I am a library author?  To get your tests back in check you can use --intialize-at-build-time which will revert to the previous behaviour.  Then use the flag -H:+PrintClassInitialization to see when classes get initialized. Based on this output you can make the proper configuration.  Configure your native-image.properties by passing --intialize-at-build-time=&amp;lt;csv-of-classes-or-packages&amp;gt; to it.  Submit a pull request to the downstream libraries with the configuration you believe works well. That way your native-image.properties will be concerned only with the classes from your framework.  There is a known issue with lambdas being initialized at build time. If your lambda inherits an interface with a default method and static fields, those fields will get pulled into the image. We will provide a fix to this bug in the next two weeks.JavaScript  Fixed various bugs that address compilation problems.R  Fixed a fatal error on Linux platforms when sending SIGINT during long computations.  Fixed issues with the installation to protected locations: the default Renviron file sets the R_LIBS_USER to a directory inside the current user’s home. Users still have to create this directory manually. Alternatively, the configure_fastr script creates the directory, but for the current user only.  Implemented missing C API: S_realloc.Ruby  Various bug fixes. Most notably fixes around OpenSSL C extension compilation.  Renamed methods in the TruffleRuby object.Ideal Graph Visualizer (IGV)  Fixed the issue with the ASTs and call trees not showing up.",

          "content": "19.1.1(2019-07-16)This is a Critical Patch Update (CPU) release for the 19.1.0 GraalVM releaseinduced by the update to OracleJDK 8u221 and OpenJDK 8u222 as the base JDKs.More details can be foundhereand here. We recommend upgradingto it from the 19.1.x and older releases.This CPU release includes fixes for the following CVEs:  CVE-2019-2813  CVE-2019-2862For more information please see the Oracle July 2019 Security Advisory.Critical fixes to GraalVM Native Image listed below went also into this version:      Fixed Reflection.getCallerClass methods sometimes failing to acquire the correct frame in the native images (#1479).        Fixed an issue that could cause header files not being generated in the working directory when compiling shared libraries ahead-of-time.  19.1.0(2019-07-02)This is a feature release, we recommend upgrading to it from the 19.0.x releases.Java  Improved speed of just-in-time (JIT) compilation in GraalVM, which significantlyimproves the performance on medium length workloads.  Applied profile-guided optimization (PGO) when building the ahead-of-time (AOT) image of the compiler. This enables more aggressive optimization of the compiler itself providing better compilation throughput.Native imageWe fixed many issues that were reported on GitHub. You can browse the full list here.JavaScript  Added an experimental option js.locale to set the default locale for locale-sensitive operations.  Allow making evaluated sources internal using the sourceURL directive by prefixing the URL with internal:, e.g., //# sourceURL=internal:myname.js.  Improved code sharing across threads. Prior to this one context had to be closed before the code in it could be reused in another context , now for JavaScript contexts one can share code using ContextPolicy.SHARED without closing the context.In the following example the source code is shared between context1 and context2:public static void main(String[] args) {        try (Engine engine = Engine.create()) {            Source source = Source.create(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;21 + 21&quot;);            try (              Context context1 = Context.newBuilder().engine(engine).build();              Context context2 = Context.newBuilder().engine(engine).build()) {                context1.eval(source).asInt();                context2.eval(source).asInt();            }        }    }LLVM interpreter  Calling exit(...) in an embedded context is now a catchable PolyglotException.  Skip source path entries that we are not allowed to access. Previously, whenrunning in an embedded context with restricted access to the file system, theLLVM engine threw an exception when it could not read the source files, even ifno debugger was attached. Now it will still run. Only when a debugger isattached, an error is reported when the source file can’t be accessed.RubyThe GraalVM Ruby implementation in this version targets performance and compatibility improvements, new features implementations and multiple bug fixes. The most notable include:  Interactive sources (like the GraalVM polyglot shell) now all share the same binding (#1695).  Hash code calculation has been improved to reduce hash collisions for Hash and other cases.  eval(code, binding) for a fixed code containing blocks is now much faster. This improves the performance of rendering ERB templates containing loops.  rb_str_cat is faster due to the C string now being concatenated without first being converted to a Ruby string or having its encoding checked.A complete changelog for the Ruby component is available on GitHub.R  Strings -Inf, +NaN, and -NaN are correctly parsed to doubles including ignoring leading and trailing whitespaces.  For loop creates and initializes the control variable even if there are no iterations (#77).  Updated the output of the capabilities builtin (#78).  is.function returns true for foreign executables.The complete project changelog is available on GitHub.Python  Updated Python standard library files from 3.7.0 to 3.7.3.  Improved performance of exceptions that do not escape.  Fixed caching of core sources in a native image with a preinitialized contextfor pre-built images and libpolyglot fast startup.  Implemented support for pwd.getpwuid, os.exec, os.execv, and os.execl modules.To see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project changelog.",

The updateis to address security vulnerabilities announced in the October 2019 Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory. The 19.2.1 version is a full distribution and and it is recommended to upgrade to it from older GraalVM versions.Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition 19.2.1 includes all the Java security fixes released as part of that CPU and mentioned in the Java SE 8 Release notes.  It also includes the following:  Update GraalVM Enterprise base Java to the 8u231 Oracle JDK version  Update GraalVM Community base Java to the 8u232 OpenJDK version  Update Node.js to 10.16.3Listed below are critical fixes that also went into this version:  Fixed a problem that prevented creating a native image including the GraalVM JavaScript engine combined with java.lang.CharSequence implementations that have non-trivial implementations of the length and charAt methods (see #1625).  Fixed a problem that could allow an exception to propagate past a catch clause that should handle it.Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customers can use GraalVM Enterprise environment in their cloud instances by simply installing it with yum. For more details, please seeGraalVM on OCI. Note: We currently do not recommend macOS users to upgrade to Catalina – a next majorrelease of macOS desktop operating system. We can not guarantee completecompatibility with GraalVM 19.2.1 or older versions yet.19.2.0.1(2019-09-13)We prepared a high severity update for GraalVM to address the following issues:  Fixed a critical compiler bug that caused String.indexOf to be executed incorrectly on older machines that do not support the TZCNT instruction. The problem causes incorrect string operations and typically shows up as truncated string values.  Fixed a bug causing the bounds check in Native Image’s implementation of System.arraycopy to overflow with large indices which typically causes process termination.  Fixed a bounds check for System.arraycopy in cases where the array is “virtualized” (i.e., can be in registers and stack slots instead of on the heap).  Removed declaration of otherwise unused SIOCGSTAMP symbol in Native Image. This allows use of Native Image on any Linux distro using a 5.2.x kernel such as the latest versions of Fedora, Ubuntu (except LTS release users), Arch, openSUSE (tumbleweed).19.2.0(2019-08-20)This is a GraalVM feature release, we recommend upgrading to it from the 19.1.x or older releases.Native ImageWe simplified the process of collecting data for profile-guided optimizations (PGO) for GraalVM Enterprise native images. PGO allows to optimize performance of native images by analyzing collected profiles during the image generation process. Since 19.2.0 you can collect data for PGO while running your application in a just-in-time (JIT) compiled mode:$ /graal-ee-19.2.0/bin/java -Dgraal.PGOInstrument=myclass.iprof MyClass$ /graal-ee-19.2.0/bin/native-image --pgo=myclass.iprof MyClass$ ./myclassPerformanceWe improved throughput for native image in GraalVM Enterprise when no profiles are available. Running the Micronaut GraalVM example shows spending ~10% less CPU time and achieving a ~10% higher throughput of requests per CPU second in 19.2.We also solved a common usability problem when a class marked forinitialization at runtime gets inadvertently initialized at build time. The flag -H:+TraceClassInitialization was introduced to help tracing what classes got initialized at runtime.JavaScript  We added support for date, time, timezone, instant and duration interoperabilitytypes to distinguish date-like objects from multiplelanguages in polyglot contexts (see changes to GraalVM SDK and Truffle APIs).  Added Context.Builder.timeZone to set the time zone.  We implemented the Numeric separators TC39 proposal. It isavailable in ECMAScript 2020 mode (--js.ecmascript-version=2020).  We moved ICU data for internationalization APIs, e.g., date and time formatting, number formatting, collation for each individual supported language, previously distributed as separate files in &amp;lt;JAVA_HOME&amp;gt;/jre/languages/js/icu4j/icudt to the executable of JavaScript (js).More changes are listed in the JavaScript component changelog.LLVM InterpreterWe added preliminary support for compiling native programs to bitcode usingthe LLVM toolchain. The LLVM toolchain is a set of tools and APIs for compilingnative projects, such as C and C++, to bitcode that can be executed with theGraalVM LLVM runtime. It is aimed to simplify ahead-of-time compilation forusers and language implementers who want to use the GraalVM LLVM runtime. To doso, we provide launchers that invoke the C/C++ compiler with special flags toproduce results that can be executed by the GraalVM LLVM runtime. For moredetails, please consult the LLVM reference documentation.The toolchain is an experimental feature in this release.A complete list of changes to GraalVM LLVM runtime can be found in thechangelog.RubyA comprehensive list of changes to Ruby language component is available on GitHub. Major changes include:  Implemented support for Fiddle – an extension to translate a foreign function interface (FFI) and libffi wrapper for Ruby.  In terms of compatibility, Thread.report_on_exception is now true by defaultlike MRI 2.5+; BigDecimal compatibility has been generally improved in severalways.  Improved the performance by optimizing String methods to use the vectorinstructions when searching for a single-byte character in a String.  Fixed several bugs reported by community:          Set RbConfig::CONFIG[&#39;ruby_version&#39;] to the same value as the TruffleRuby version. This fixes reusing C extensions between different versions of TruffleRuby with Bundler (#1715).      Improved errors when interacting with single-threaded languages (#1709).      R  Added a new fastRCluster package that allows to run FastR inside GNU-R:          install in GNU-R or RStudio with: devtools::install_github(&#39;oracle/fastr/com.oracle.truffle.r.pkgs/fastRCluster&#39;);      use ?fastRCluster to learn more.        The problem that SET_ATTRIB does not validate the attributes as expected was resolved.The changelog is available on GitHub.PythonThe GraalVM Python implementation is still experimental and we are working towards improving completeness.  Implemented PyStructSequence_* C API – standard structured prediction functions.  Added support for more C API functions as PyEval_InitThreads and PyEval_ThreadsInitialized, type attributes i.e. nb_remainder, nb_subtract, overflowed and recursion_depth thread state fields.  Fixed printing of errors in the REPL and full paths in tracebacks.More details are available in the project changelog on GitHub.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)We implemented the ability to configure custom polyglot access configuration withPolyglotAccess.newBuilder(). It allows to configure fine-grained accesscontrol for polyglot bindings and between polyglot languages. For example, givena TruffleObject as a value, there is a need to determine language and type ofthat object. This feature is significant for GraalVM execution inside OracleRDBMS.GraalVM 19.2.0 release also added support for date, time, timezone, durationvalues in polyglot APIs, and introduced the Context.Builder.timeZone(ZoneId)class to configure the default timezone of polyglot contexts.The major GraalVM SDK and Truffle APIs changes between the versions are summarized in:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsA preview version of Java Flight Recorder (JFR) support has been released as a plugin for the VisualVM tool bundled with GraalVM 19.2.0. The plugin reads all JFR snapshots created from Java 7 and newer and presents the data in typical VisualVM views familiar for its users.To install the JFR support, download GraalVM 19.2.0 from graalvm.org/downloads, unzip it and run /bin/jvisualvm to start VisualVM.Use `Tools | Plugins | Available Plugins` to list all available plugins and install the VisualVM-JFR and VisualVM-JFR-Generic modules.The JFR snapshots can be opened using either the File | Load… action or by double-clicking the JFR Snapshots node and adding the snapshot into the JFR repository permanently.Please follow the documentation of your Java installation how to create JFR snapshots.JFR support is currently anexperimentalfeature. Some advanced features like analyzing JVM internals, showing eventstack traces or support for creating JFR snapshots from live processes are notavailable in the preview version and will be addressed incrementally in thefollowing releases.GraalVM Updater UtilityWe fixed an issue where GraalVM Enterprise would by default download the GraalVM Community components from GitHub. If you are using GraalVM Community – nothing changes, you can still install the components as before, and the gu will locate the necessary jar files on GitHub and correctly install them:gu install native-image ruby R pythonIf you are using GraalVM Enterprise, you can install R and llvm-toolchain components from GitHub, for example:gu install RThe other components are available from the OTN page, and can be installed from a manually downloaded file, for example to install native-image support run:gu -L install native-image-installable-svm-svmee-darwin-amd64-19.2.0.jarVersion CalendarYou can now refer to GraalVM version calendar to learn more about the GraalVM release model and prepare for upcoming releases.",

This issue inthe GraalVM build process will be remedied in future releases.Listed below are issues addressed in this release:  Resolved the issue of NullPointerException being thrown with SecurityServicesFeature when the application uses non-JDK related services (#1893).  Made efforts to turn Code coverage command line tool more reliable (#1800).  Prevented linking errors in Unsafe and ClassLoader by substituting all native methods (#1920).  Made dynamically generate On_Load_* function call for static libraries so all libraries are known before the image generation to prevent -Djava.net.preferIPv6Addresses=true returning an incorrect value (#1937).  Fixed ProcessHandle properties not providing useful values when running a native image (#2001).  Fixed an unsynchronized java.util.WeakHashMap.get access when single engine isshared between several thread local polyglot contexts (#1916).  Fixed an issue of JDK 11  GraalVM build not being recognized by macOS /usr/libexec/java_home -V (#801).  Implemented a new C APIs used by JSON 2.3.0 (#1857).  Ensured that GraalVM Native Image does  not have references to native methods from java.lang.reflect.Proxy (#1971).  Ensured that all native methods of core classes would be substituted to prevent reflection configuration issues (#1848).  Fixed an issue leading to JavaFX applications misbehave with GraalArithmeticStubs (#1867).  Ensured that DynamicProxySupport classes being called from multiple threads are thread safe (#1927).  Prevent static field values changing during a native image generation (#1945).  Fixed the issue with the native linking step at image writing phase when the image uses functions from unsupported static JDK libraries (#1875).19.3.0.2(2019-12-24)This is a bugfix update including fixes to the JVM Compiler Interface (JVMCI) and necessary updates to the JDK 11 support.The following issues were addressed:  Approached the issue of DynamicProxySupport being not thread safe when DynamicProxySupport.addProxyClass is called from multiple threads (see #1927).  Resolved a problem leading to a wrong execution of the code produced with the GraalVM native-image builder at optimization level 2 -H:Optimize=2 (see #1995).  Fixed a problem when JavaFX applications misbehave with GraalArithmeticStubs (see #1867).  Resolved an issue of VM crashing when run with Serial GC (see #1892).  ReduceInitialCardMarks is unsafe with OptBulkAllocation in JDK 11 (see #1915).  Fixed a transient crash while building native images with GraalVM based on JDK11 (see #1906).19.3.0(2019-11-19)GraalVM 19.3 is the first planned Medium-Term Support (MTS) release built fromthe main line of the project. This is also a major feature release and it is arecommended upgrade to it. The MTS status assures that stability, security, andperformance fixes will be backported from the current branch for the next 18months.GraalVM JDK 11 Based BuildsWith the major update to the 19.3 version, we announce the first release ofGraalVM based on JDK 11! This represents a substantial milestone given thedifferences between JDK 8 and JDK 11. In particular, the Java Platform ModuleSystem (JPMS) introduced in JDK 9 means GraalVM now uses module encapsulation to isolate code such as JVMCI, the GraalVM compiler and the Truffle API from application code. In addition, it means GraalVM on JDK 11 includes all theJDK changes since JDK 8. These are detailed in the release notes for JDK 9,JDK 10and JDK 11.In terms of languages, GraalVM on JDK11 supports all JVM languages (Java, Scala etc.) aswell as all guest languages currently supported in GraalVM on JDK8.Due to the modular structure of the base JDK, there is no more $JAVA_HOME/jre/ directoryin the GraalVM package based on JDK 11. This has an impact on the path to the languages location,e.g., $JAVA_HOME/jre/languages/js now becomes $JAVA_HOME/languages/js):GraalVM Native Imageon JDK 11 allows usage of all JDK 8 command line options. Currently the nativeimage builder ($JAVA_HOME/bin/native-image) does not support the JavaPlatform Module System (JPMS) and has no module introspection at image run time.Pease note, at present GraalVM Updater cannot rebuild images ($JAVA_HOME/bin/gu rebuild-images) with GraalVM Enterprise and Community editions on JDK 11. Even if GraalVM Native Image is installed, a user will encounter the following error while rebuilding:$ $JAVA_HOME/bin/gu rebuild-images rubyError: rebuild-images utility is not available. You may need to install &quot;native-image&quot; component.Please refer to documentation for the details.A possible workaround is to rebuild images invoking rebuild-images command directly, e.g.:$JAVA_HOME/bin/rebuild-images rubyPlease be informed, to have GraalVM JDK 11 based build on macOS listed by /usr/libexec/java_home -V you need to:  extract the GraalVM archive to /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/ location  mkdir /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/graalvm-ce-java11-19.3.0/Contents/MacOS  cd /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/graalvm-ce-java11-19.3.0/Contents/MacOS  ln -s ../Home/lib/jli/libjli.dylibThis issue will be fixed in the next release.GraalVM JDK 11 on ARM64We provide a preview of GraalVM Community Edition on JDK 11 for ARM64architecture. It includes the support for all JVM languages. The support for theother languages should follow soon after. This distribution includes GraalVMNative Image off the shelf to build instantly starting applications whichconsume less memory in ARM64 environments.There are some known limitations with this distribution at the moment:  npm and node do not support runtime code installation (Trufflecompilations). To avoid failing with java.lang.NullPointerException, disableTruffle compilations with npm --vm.Dgraal.TruffleCompilation=false or node--vm.Dgraal.TruffleCompilation=false.  npm and node crash with  a free(): invalid pointer error.Native ImageGraalVM 19.3 switched to using the JDK native code instead of manualsubstitutions. For GraalVM Native Image this switch to Java Native Interface(JNI) platform enabled the possibility to provide support for JDK 11 andextended support for Windows OS. It has no impact on startup time or memoryfootprint, and eliminates the need for shipping JDK libraries such aslibsunec.so along with native images that use Java crypto services. GraalVMnow ships with statically linkable version of the JDK libraries.Note that the sunec native library of SunEC provider gets statically linkedinto an image if required (see#951). Thus native images do notdepend on the sunec shared library anymore at runtime. However, if SunECprovider gets statically linked into an image on Linux and macOS the image willdepend on libstdc++.Native Image Maven PluginSupport for using GraalVM Native Image with Maven was introduced with theNative Image Maven Plugin. It means auser can build a project and its native image directly with Maven using the mvnpackage command. As of the GraalVM version 19.3, the Maven &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt; for theGraalVM Native Image related artifacts, including the plugin, changed fromcom.oracle.substratevm to org.graalvm.nativeimage:&amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.nativeimage&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;native-image-maven-plugin&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;19.3.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;executions&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;execution&amp;gt;            &amp;lt;goals&amp;gt;                &amp;lt;goal&amp;gt;native-image&amp;lt;/goal&amp;gt;            &amp;lt;/goals&amp;gt;            &amp;lt;phase&amp;gt;package&amp;lt;/phase&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;/execution&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;/executions&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;skip&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/skip&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;buildArgs&amp;gt;            --no-fallback        &amp;lt;/buildArgs&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/plugin&amp;gt;To use the plugin make sure GraalVM home is set as your JAVA_HOME environment and Native Image is installed. Using the plugin without GraalVM is not recommend.GraalVM Compiler  We have improved System.arraycopy to eliminate store checks when copying toObject[]. That improvement fixes slowdowns (versus C2) on some EclipseCollections benchmarks.  A performance regression when creating List values in Scala has been fixed bymore optimized inlining.  Fixed an issue that could prevent a method from being compiled that contains the JSR bytecode produced by older javac versions (see #1699).JavaScriptThe Node.js runtime available with GraalVM was updated to the 12.10.0 version, which brought some breaking changes.Additional proposals for ECMAScript 2020 have been implemented (Promise.allSettled and Nullish coalescing) and are available in ECMAScript 2020 mode (--js.ecmascript-version=2020).To provide better compatibility with the ECMAScript specification, some extensions are now disabled by default, some depending on the launcher (js, node, or via GraalVM Polyglot Context). This includes the print and printErr functions (the js.print flag), the global built-in (superseded by globalThis, use the js.global-property flag to reenable), or the performance global property (the js.performance flag).More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.LLVM InterpreterIn GraalVM 19.3 clang and other LLVM tools are no longer required to beinstalled for building the GraalVM LLVM runtime. The LLVM toolchain bundled with GraalVM is used.Also the LLVM toolchain is not an “experimental” feature any more and is used by other languages.For example, save this native code demonstrating the interoperability with Java as a polyglot.c file:#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;polyglot.h&amp;gt;int main() {    void *arrayType = polyglot_java_type(&quot;int[]&quot;);    void *array = polyglot_new_instance(arrayType, 4);    polyglot_set_array_element(array, 2, 42);    int element = polyglot_as_i32(polyglot_get_array_element(array, 2));    printf(&quot;%dn&quot;, element);    return element;}Now you can compile it using GraalVM drop-in replacement of traditional clang:$JAVA_HOME/jre/languages/llvm/native/bin/clang polyglot.c -o polyglotThen run the executable (polyglot) with its dependencies encoded in GraalVM LLVM runtime:lli polyglotList of features that have also been added:  Preliminary support for parsing bitcode produced by LLVM 9  Added intrinsics for pthread thread management functions  Support for pthreads LLVM bitcodeRefer to the component changelog on GitHub.Python  Updated Python standard library to 3.7.4.  Implemented support for NumPy 1.16.4 and Pandas 0.25.0, that can be installed with:$ graalpython -m ginstall install numpy$ graalpython -m ginstall install pandas  With the help of Weblogic Scripting Team in conversion of Jython into GraalVM Python,added Jython compatibility (enabled with --python.EmulateJython) that allows importing ofJava classes and catching of Java exceptions in Python the same way Jython allows it.$ graalpython --jvm --experimental-option --python.EmulateJython&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import sun.misc.Signal&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from java.lang import Integer, NumberFormatException&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; try:...   Integer.parseInt(&quot;99&quot;, 8)... except NumberFormatException as e:...   pass  Added support for basic sockets. Note that SSL is not implemented, thus there is no https yet:import urllib.requestprint(urllib.request.urlopen(&quot;http://google.com&quot;).read())  Implemented missing functions and fixed bugs to run various modules (timeit, socket, pytest).  Improved performance of Java interoperability, exceptions that do not escape,various C API functions, and the parser. The parser is ~20% faster now, sometimes upto ~40%, the performance in micro benchmarks is 5x faster, micro benchmarks forC API are 5x faster, but there is no change to NumPy performance numbers.To see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project changelog.R  FastR has been updated to R version 3.6.1.  In this release, FastR does not ship with GCC runtime libraries. Use the following commands to install the necessary dependencies:          Ubuntu 18.04 and 19.04: apt-get install libgfortran3 libgomp1      Oracle Linux 7: yum install libgfortran libgomp      Oracle Linux 8: yum install compat-libgfortran-48      MacOS: brew install gcc@4.9        Preview of support for LLVM based execution of R native extensions.          FastR is configured to use the GraalVM LLVM toolchain to compile the C/C++ and Fortran code of R packages. The resulting binarieswill contain both the native code and the LLVM bitcode. The R packages that are shipped with FastR were also compiledusing the GraalVM LLVM toolchain and their binaries contain the LLVM bitcode.      FastR loads and runs the R extensions native code by default, but when run with the option --R.BackEnd=llvm,it will load and run the LLVM bitcode if available. You can use the LLVM backend selectively for specific R packages via --R.BackEndLLVM=pkg1,pkg2.      If you encounter any issues when installing R packages, you can switch back from the GraalVM LLVM toolchainto the native toolchain by running fastr.setToolchain(&quot;native&quot;) or by manually editing the $FASTR_HOME/etc/Makeconf file.        Fixed memory leaks reported on GitHub.  Fixed failures when working with large vectors (&amp;gt;1GB).  Implemented grepRaw, but only for fixed=T.We encourage the users to experiment with the new LLVM support and report anyissues to GitHub. To see thecomplete list of changes, please refer to the projectchangelog.RubyA comprehensive list of changes to the Ruby language component is available on GitHub.The focus has been on improving compatibility with Ruby on Rails applications.Major changes include:  Compilation of C extensions is now done with an internal LLVM toolchain producing both native code and bitcode. This means more C extensions should compile out of the box and this should resolve most linker-related issues.  It is no longer necessary to install LLVM for installing C extensions on TruffleRuby.  It is no longer necessary to install libc++ and libc++abi for installing C++ extensions on TruffleRuby.  On macOS, it is no longer necessary to install the system headers package (#1417).  License updated to EPL 2.0/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1 like recent JRuby.  Installing sassc now works due to using the LLVM toolchain (#1753).  Include executables of default gems, needed for rails new in Rails 6.ToolsCode Coverage Command Line ToolAs of version 19.3 GraalVM provides a code coverage command line tool to recordand analyze the source code coverage of a particular execution of code forlanguages implemented with the Truffle framework. Enable it with --codecoverageoption, for example js --codecoverage. Visit the tool reference documentation for moreinformation.GraalVM VisualVM  Previously, to view the JFR files you had to install a plugin. Now GraalVM VisualVM contains the viewer in the tool core. Other JFR viewer improvements include new views for Exceptions and GC, improved performance and accuracy.  The tool is now able to monitor and profile AArch64 Java and Java 13 processes.Debugger  Enabled support for functional breakpoints and memory tools in Chrome Inspector.Visual Studio Code ExtensionsVSCode extensions are provided as VSIX packages. GraalVM team created the firstVSIX extension based on Python implementation. The extension installs with npmpackage manager and upon the extension installation, the user is requested topoint the PATH environment variable to GraalVM home directory.Changes for GraalVM Embedders (SDK)  Added new APIs for statement count resource limits:ResourceLimits.newBuilder()ResourceLimits.newBuilder()    .statementLimit(1000, null)    .build();              Duration.ofMillis(10))    .statementLimit(1000, null).build();try (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                .resourceLimits(limits).build()) {    context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;while(true);&quot;);    assert false;} catch (PolyglotException e) {    assert e.isCancelled();}  The default temporary directory can now be configured by FileSystem. A getTempDirectory()method of the FileSystem interface will return the default temporary directory.  Added the org.graalvm.home.Version version utility that allows to create, validate and compare GraalVM versions.  Added support for detecting and mapping polyglot exception values. Exceptions can be detected using Value.isException().  Added default target type mapping from guest language exceptions to PolyglotException.Proceed to the GraalVM SDK changelog for the complete list of changes.Changes for GraalVM Language or Tool Implementers (Truffle)  Added standard block node for language implementations. The block node usage allows the optimizingruntime to group elements of a block into multiple block compilation units. This optimization may beenabled using --engine.PartialBlockCompilation (on by default) and configuredusing --engine.PartialBlockCompilationSize (default 3000).  Merged new experimental inlining heuristic. Inlining budgets are now based on Graal IR nodecounts and no longer Truffle Node counts.  Support boolean literals in Truffle DSL expressions. Use true or false in expressions,e.g., isFunction(value) == false.  Added support for temporary files and directories.  Threads created by the embedder may now be collected by the GC before they canbe disposed. If languages hold onto thread objects exposed viainitializeThread they now need to do so with WeakReference. This avoidsleaking thread instances.  Added the new execute method to LoopNode, which allows loops to return values.To see the full list of changes to the APIs, proceed to theGraalVM Truffle changelog.",

This will benefit GraalVM and OpenJDK contributors, our partners, customers, and the broader Java ecosystem. It will pave a path towards the elimination of obstacles to wider ecosystem adoption and participation in the development of GraalVM technologies. Some of these obstacles include differences in release schedules, features, and development processes.                    By moving GraalVM to the OpenJDK Community, these technologies will be developed using the same successful methods and processes that a large community of companies, organizations, individual developers, and academics have used to move Java forward transparently and predictably for more than a decade.                          What parts of GraalVM Community Edition does Oracle plan to contribute to the OpenJDK Community?                      Oracle plans to contribute the most applicable portions of the GraalVM just-in-time (JIT) compiler and Native Image. Oracle does not currently intend to contribute the polyglot technologies supporting other languages such as Python, Ruby, R, and JavaScript. Additional details will follow in the coming months as we move forward through this process.                  How does Oracle plan to contribute the code?                      Oracle plans to contribute the suitable GraalVM technologies into one or more OpenJDK projects, in accordance with the OpenJDK Community processes. Additional details will follow in the coming months.                  Which versions of the GraalVM Community Edition code does Oracle plan to migrate?                      Oracle plans to contribute the GraalVM technologies currently in development. Previous versions of these technologies will remain in the GraalVM GitHub organization.                  How will GraalVM Community Edition technologies be developed in the OpenJDK Community?                              GraalVM technologies will be developed in accordance with the methods and processes used in the OpenJDK Community. That means that there will be at least one Project with Committers and Reviewers. If and when a GraalVM technology is ready to become part of a main-line JDK release, a JDK Enhancement Proposal (JEP) will be submitted.            GraalVM technologies will be developed with the same kind of transparency and predictability that Java developers have come to expect from other Oracle-led Projects in the OpenJDK Community.                  Will there be a GraalVM JEP?                      The JEP planning process provides transparency into JDK development for the entire Java ecosystem. Any sufficiently large feature destined for the JDK main line goes through the JEP Process, since that is how JDK releases are planned in the OpenJDK Community. When suitable portions of the GraalVM technologies are ready to be proposed for inclusion into the main-line JDK source code, they will be accompanied by one or more JEPs.                   Will the GraalVM license change?                      The plan is to align all the GraalVM technologies with Java both from a release perspective and from a licensing perspective. Additional details will follow in the coming months as we move forward through this process.                  Where can I learn more about it?                      You will be able to learn more about the details of the migration of GraalVM technologies to the OpenJDK Community through the inside.java news aggregation site (which may point to content from multiple sources), as we continue to move forward through this process — just as you would learn about any other interesting bits of Java platform development news.                  Will GraalVM Community dev builds be published from the OpenJDK Projects?                      Oracle-led OpenJDK Projects such as Loom, Panama, and Valhalla all publish Early Access releases on jdk.java.net. Early Access releases of the contributed GraalVM Community Edition technologies may be made available in a similar fashion, as we move forward through this process.                  What does the alignment with the Java release model mean in practice?                      Oracle plans to align future GraalVM releases with the JDK release model:                                          Support for one Java SE Platform Specification per release                Two feature releases per year                Four predictable, quarterly Critical Patch Updates annually                A Long-Term Support Release every two years                                      The alignment of the release model is planned for CY 2023, pending the migration to OpenJDK development and contribution processes.                  What are the plans for Native Image?                      Oracle plans to contribute the most applicable parts of the GraalVM Native Image implementation to the OpenJDK Community. Once contributed, the Native Image technology would continue to be developed within the scope of an OpenJDK Project, using the same processes and methods as other OpenJDK development. Oracle plans to evolve the Native Image technology in the OpenJDK Community to track the Project Leyden specification as it progresses to pave a path to fully-static images in a future release of the Java SE Platform specification.                  I’m a GraalVM CE or GraalVM EE user. Will this change affect me?                      Ongoing updates for previous GraalVM releases will continue as anticipated with the release schedule getting aligned with Java releases in CY23. This change only affects future development of select open-source GraalVM technologies. Java users will benefit from the alignment of release schedules and cadence as well as easier access to innovation.                      ",

          "content": "20.0.0(2020-02-18)GraalVM Platform UpdatesGraalVM 20.0 improves significantly on the previously available GraalVM buildsfor Windows platforms. Windows is no longer an experimental platform in the GraalVM ecosystem.Windows builds now contain the functional gu utility to install thecomponents. GraalVM Native Image component needs to be installedwith gu as on other platforms. JavaScript engine is now included in the GraalVM Windows distribution. Node.js support on the Windows platform is scheduled to be included in the next GraalVM release (20.1).GraalWasm, the WebAssembly component, is distributed through the usual component distribution channels.The GraalVM distribution for AArch64 now includes a functional node.js runtime (both in --jvm and native modes).Java  GraalVM Community Editions are based on OpenJDK version 1.8.0_242 and OpenJDK version 11.0.6.  GraalVM Enterprise Editions are based on Oracle JDK version 1.8.0_241 and Oracle JDK version 11.0.6. You can find the JDK release notes at the Oracle Technology Network website.  Added mitigation of Jump Conditional Code (JCC) Erratum (see #1829).  GraalVM has a default setting of ThreadPriorityPolicy=1, which means thread priorities set in Java are reflected by native operating sytstem thread priorities. This may affect Java application performance.Native Image  Native Image support on Windows has significantly advanced. Please report issues if you find any problems.  Native images built with GraalVM Enterprise can now include a G1-based low-latency garbage collector that reduces stop-the-world pauses and improves latency. It is an experimental feature that can be enabled at image build time with -H:+UseLowLatencyGC. For more details, please refer to the documentation.  Fixed several Java Native Interface (JNI) and JDK11 related issues, please refer to GitHub for more information.JavaScript  Updated Node.js to 12.15.0, please see Node.js 12.15.0 release notes.  Added the js.commonjs-require option to load npm-compatible CommonJS modules from plain JavaScript. This is an experimental feature. See NodeJSVSJavaScriptContext.md for details.  Added the js.load-from-classpath option to allow loading files from the classpath via the classpath: pseudo URLs (disabled by default). Its usage is not recommended with untrusted code.  Added the implementation of the String.prototype.replaceAll proposal. It is available in ECMAScript 2020 mode (--js.ecmascript-version=2020).  Updated String.prototype.matchAll to be available only in ECMAScript 2020 mode (--js.ecmascript-version=2020).  Added the js.bind-member-functions option for the implicit binding of unbound functions returned by Value.getMember to the receiver. The preferred way of calling members is using Value.invokeMember.  Made the support for Nashorn pseudo URLs available only in the Nashorn compatibility mode (--js.nashorn-compat).  Implemented support for public and private class fields, including static fields. This feature can be enabled using the experimental option js.class-fields and is available by default in Node.js.  Added the js.global-arguments option with true as a default value for the non-standard arguments global property.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.LLVM Runtime  The toolchain is now based on LLVM 9.0.0.  Support accessing llvm-ar, llvm-nm, llvm-objcopy, llvm-objdump, llvm-ranlib, llvm-readelf, llvm-readobj and llvm-strip via the toolchain.For more details refer to the component changelog on GitHub.Python  Improved Jython Compatibility by implementing syntax from JavaType import * to import all static members of a Java class, and by enabling import of Python code from inside JAR files by adding path/to/jarfile.jar!path/inside/jar to sys.path.  Added support for date and time interop.  Added support for setting the time zone via Context.Builder.timeZone.  Implemented PEP 570 - Python Positional-Only Parameters.To see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project changelog.R  On Linux, the required version of libgfortran changed from 3 to 5. See the requirements section for details.  Implemented subsetting an array by numeric and/or string matrix.  Fixed an issue where polyglot value is not an object (see #123).  Fixed an issue with the incorrect formatting for sprintf %g and %G (trailing zeroes, see #126).  Added  R builtins and C APIs:          Ported all external C functions used by nlm (see #100) and fisher.test from the stats base package.      Added Rf_asS4 C API function (see #118).      More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.RubyA detailed changelog for the Ruby component is available on GitHub.  Updated to Ruby 2.6.5 (see #1749).  Updated the internal LLVM toolchain to LLVM 9 and reduce its download size.  Automatically set PKG_CONFIG_PATH as needed for compiling OpenSSL on macOS (see #1830).  Performance improvements related to sockets and RSTRING_PTR.  100+ compatibility and bug fixes, please refer to the changelog.Changes for GraalVM Embedders (SDK)  The deprecated graalvm.home and graalvm.version system properties have been removed, use the HomeFinder instead.  Added EventContext.createError which allows to introduce guest application errors in execution listeners/nodes.  Added Context.Builder.currentWorkingDirectory to set the current working directory used by the guest application to resolve relative paths.  The algorithm used to generate a unique URI for a Source built without an URI was changed to SHA-256.  All Truffle Graal runtime options (-Dgraal.) will be deprecated with 20.1. The Truffle runtime options are no longer specified as Graal options (-Dgraal.). The Graal options must be replaced by corresponding engine options specified using the polyglot API. The TRUFFLE_STRICT_OPTION_DEPRECATION environment variable can be used to detect usages of deprecated GraalVM options. When the TRUFFLE_STRICT_OPTION_DEPRECATION is set to true and the deprecated Graal option is used, the Truffle runtime throws an exception listing the used deprecated options and corresponding replacements.More details are in the SDK and Truffle changelogs.Tooling  Added an option for gu to install all available components from a local directory, for example: gu install -C /path/to/downloaded/20.0-components/ native-image llvm-toolchain ruby r python wasm.  Added a JDK Flight Recorder Data Viewer to VisualVM.  Added an integration of T-trace instrumentation framework with OpenTracing.  Added LLVM languages support to T-trace instrumentation framework  Added a Technology Preview of the Language Server Protocol implementation for GraalVM languages and its support to GraalVM VSCode Extensions.",

          "content": "20.1.0(2020-05-19)Java  GraalVM Community Edition is based on OpenJDK version 1.8.0_252 and OpenJDK version 11.0.7.  Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition is based on Oracle JDK version 1.8.0_251 andOracle JDK version 11.0.7. You can find Oracle JDK release notes for theseversions at the Oracle Technology Network website.  Added support for compiling classes with irreducible loops in the bytecode. Theseoften occur in Kotlin applications using coroutines with loops. The supportboth improves performance of such applications and enables their ahead-of-time compilation.  Added new TuneInlinerExploration option to increase or decrease the time spentexploring inlining opportunities. Tuning this option helps to achieve betterpeak performance or limit time to reach (potentially lower) peak performancewhich might improve overall speed of the program. This option is only aheuristic and should be tuned for a specific application. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Added support to optimize away some redundant clone operations. For example, incode patterns similar to the one below, the GraalVM compiler will avoid creatingthe array clone:new int[length].clone().length      Added support for visualizing libgraal memory usage in VisualVM:    The mitigation of the Intel JumpConditional Code (JCC) Erratum is now only enabled for CPUs that need it.  Significantly improved performance for some benchmarks on JDK 11 due to fixes inthe area of synchronization. The most notable improvement isRenaissance:reactorswhich shows approximately 50% better results.Native Image  Improved scalability of the static analysis. The static analysis time wasinfeasible for some large applications. We added a new mechanism, called“saturated type flows”, to make the analysis faster. The new analysis isdisabled by default for GraalVM 20.1, but we plan to enable it by default in afuture release. We encourage all users to try it out using the image builderoption -H:+RemoveSaturatedTypeFlows. According to our measurements theprecision of the static analysis is comparable, but if you have an applicationwhere many more classes or methods are reachable with this option please create an issue on GitHub.  Added new option for the image generator to exit handlers on terminationsignals: --install-exit-handlers. This improves the user experience whenrunning a native image in a Docker container as the init process, since Linuxdoes not install a default signal handler for the process with id “1” and thenative image is therefore not reacting to a shutdown request from Docker.  Improved support for soft references. Before 20.1, soft references (the JavaSoftReference class) were cleared immediately at every GC like weakreferences. Now they are cleared based on a policy that takes the last accessand the memory pressure into account.  Added survivor spaces to the GC. Disabled by default until a proper policy isimplemented, see this GitHub issue for ideas and tasks aroundGC in native images.  Added generation of Dwarf debug information.  Improved support for timezones: information about all timezones is now includedin every image, and the default timezone is correctly initialized at imagestartup and no longer fixed at image generation time.  Improved checking that the native compiler toolchain is correct, for example,whether the compiler version on Windows is correct. This avoids strange errors dueto known incompatible compiler versions.Many more compatibility improvements and bug fixes can be found on GitHub. Forexample, here is a list of fixed issues relevant for Spring framework support.JavaScript  Enabled ECMAScript 2020 mode features by default.  Implemented several ECMAScript proposals, including Optional Chaining, HashbangGrammar, FinalizationRegistry, private class methods, RegExp Match Indices,export * as ns from &quot;mod&quot;, Intl.Locale, Intl.DisplayNames, Intl.DateTimeFormatdateStyle and timeStyle.  Added npx (npm package runner) utility into GraalVM distributions.  Removed the JOni RegExp-engine and the use-tregex option. TRegex engine is now the default regex engine.  Removed our SIMD.js implementation.LLVM Runtime  Added a preliminary support for running C++ code in managed mode. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Updated musl libc to version 1.1.24. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Both libc++ and libc++abi are now shipped as bitcode libraries.  Improved C++ support, libsulong++ is loaded only if libc++ is loaded. Theexecutables (ELF, Mach-O) compiled with the toolchain usually have a dependencyon this library and will continue to work. Plain bitcode files, which do notallow specification of dependencies, may fail with an error similar to thefollowing:    Global variable ZNSt3_15ctypeIcE2idE is declared but not defined.    This can be solved, for example, by specifying the dependency on the commandline lli --lib libc++.so.1 ... on Linux or lli --lib libc++.1.dylib onmacOS.    Changed module initialization order to be only based on the dependenciesrecorded in the ELF/Mach-O file (instead of looking at imported symbols). Thismight change the order in which plain bitcode files are initialized since theydo not allow recording dependencies. If the initialization order is important,the suggested approach is to use ELF/Mach-O files. See theToolchaindocumentation for more details.  Added support for on-stack-replacement of loops during bitcode execution, now itcan compile long-running loops before the surrounding function is compiled.Python  Updated to Python 3.8.2.  Improved tuples with primitive elements performance.  Improved performance of sequences, sets, dicts, and list expressions.  Added support of cProfile and trace modules through the GraalVM CPU sampler and coverage, respectively.  Added support of NumPy on macOS.  Added support of setuptools-scm and pytz.timezone.  Added support of a new syntax for iterable unpacking from yield and return statements.  Fixed issues with inspection and printing of non-Python numbers in the Chrome debugger.  Fixed issues with AST sharing across different contexts when these contexts run concurrently on multiple threads.  Fixed passing non-ASCII strings to gethostbyname.  Improved Jython compatibility mode: treat Java null as identical to Python None when comparing with the is operator.  Improved Jython compatibility mode: isinstance now works with Java classes and objects.  Moved all GraalPython specific functions on sys or builtins to the _graalpython_ module.To see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project changelog.R  Preview of improved graphical support based on the graphics, grDevices, and JavaGD packages          Use --R.UseInternalGridGraphics=false to activate this feature.      Our custom grid package re-implementation, which is currently the default, will be first deprecated and then removed in future releases.        Included GCC runtime libraries for supported systems (Linux and macOS)  Removed GFortran as a requirement to run FastR.  The GFortran runtime libraries versions are 4.8.5 on Linux and 8.3.0 on macOS. When compiling additional R packages with Fortran code, one must use GFortran of the same or higher version.          There’s a known issue: the libgomp.1.dylib library is not distributed with FastR on MacOS. To workaround this issue: install GCC with the package manager of your choice, e.g., brew install gcclocate file libgomp.1.dylib. Variable $GOMPLIB will denote full path to this library and $R_HOMEthe path to R installation:$JAVA_HOME/jre/languages/R on JDK8 based builds$JAVA_HOME/languages/R on JDK11 based buildsexecute these two commands:install_name_tool -change /cm/shared/apps/gcc/8.3.0/lib/libgomp.1.dylib $GOMPLIB $R_HOME/lib/libRblas.dylibinstall_name_tool -change /cm/shared/apps/gcc/8.3.0/lib/libgomp.1.dylib $GOMPLIB $R_HOME/lib/libRlapack.dylib        GFortran is now the default Fortran compiler even in the LLVM toolchain configuration.  Added support for traceback() to show frames from other GraalVM languages and C/C++ when run in the LLVM mode (--R.BackEnd=llvm).  Improved interoperability with other languages: “@” and “$” can be used to access members of foreign polyglot objects.A detailed list of the changes and bug fixes is available in the project changelog.Ruby  Added nightly builds, see the README for details.  ||= will not compile the right-hand-side if it is only executed once, to match the idiomatic lazy-initialization use-case (see the blog post).  Optimized performance of bundle install.  Added the --metrics-profile-require option to profile searching, parsing, translating and loading files.  Changed the C API type VALUE to be defined as unsigned long as on MRI. This enables using switch (VALUE) and other expressions which rely on VALUE being an integer type.  Removed deprecated Truffle::System.full_memory_barrier, Truffle::Primitive.logical_processors, and Truffle::AtomicReference.  Improved interoperability with other languages: hash keys are no longer reported as polyglot members.  Added Truffle::Interop.hash_keys_as_members to treat a Ruby Hash as a polyglot object with the Hash keys as members.Other 56 bug fixes and 52 compatibility improvements, see a detailed changelog.ToolingChrome Inspector  Implemented the display of asynchronous stack traces in debugger, in Chrome Inspector and in exception traces.Language Server Protocol  Improved stability of GraalVM Language Server and GraalVM VSCode Extensions.  Changed to start GraalVM Language Server in the native mode for better startup performance.  Stabilized support for LSP in R and Ruby.VisualVM  Enabled VisualVM to monitor libgraal memory usage.  Implemented showing compiled and interpreter time in the GraalVM sampler.  Improved JFR viewer to display stack traces for JFR events.Ideal Graph Visualizer      Added grouping of graph dumps by session:    Added an action to go to compiler classes.  Improved stability of IGV to no longer hang on some graph layout.GraalVM Updater gu  Added support for wildcards when GraalVM Updater installs from a directory (-C).Updates for Polyglot Embedders  Added Value.isMetaObject(), Value.getMetaQualifiedName(), Value.getMetaSimpleName() and Value.isMetaInstance(Object) to allow language agnostic access to meta-objects like classes or types.  The result of Value.getMetaObject() will always return meta-objects. It is recommended but not required to change uses of meta-objects to use Value.getMetaQualifiedName() instead of Value.toString() to return a type name.  Added OptionDescriptor.getDeprecationMessage returning the option deprecation reason. Added OptionDescriptor.Builder.deprecationMessage() to set the option deprecation reason.  Added Context.Builder.hostClassLoader to allow an embedder to specify a context ClassLoader for code execution.More changes can be found in the GraalVM SDK changelog.Updates for Language and Tool Implementers  engine.Mode is now a supported option and no longer experimental.  Added new meta-data APIs to InteropLibrary:          has/getLanguage(Object receiver) to access the original language of an object      has/getSourceLocation(Object receiver) to access the source location of an object (e.g., a function or classes)      has/toDisplayString(Object receiver, boolean allowsSideEffect) to produce a human-readable string      has/getMetaObject(Object receiver) to access the meta-object of an object      isMetaObject(Object receiver) to find out whether an object is a meta-object (e.g., Java class)      getMetaQualifiedName(Object receiver) to get the qualified name of a meta-object      getMetaSimpleName(Object receiver) to get the simple name of a the meta-object      isMetaInstance(Object receiver, Object instance) to check whether an object is an instance of a meta-object        Added TruffleLanguage.getLanguageView that allows to wrap values to add language specific information for primitive and foreign values.  Added TruffleLanguage.getScopedView that allows to wrap values to add scoping and visibility to language values.  Added TruffleInstrument.Env.getScopedView and TruffleInstrument.Env.getLanguageView to access language and scoped views from instruments.  Added TruffleInstrument.Env.getLanguageInfo to convert language classes to LanguageInfo.  Added @GenerateLibrary(dynamicDispatchEnabled = false) that allows to disable dynamic dispatch semantics for a library. The default is true.  Added ability to load external default exports for libraries using a service provider. See GenerateLibrary(defaultExportLookupEnabled = true).  Added @ExportLibrary(transitionLimit=&quot;3&quot;) that allows the accepts condition of exported libraries to transition from true to false for a library created for a receiver instance. This is, for example, useful to export messages for array strategies.  Added support for asynchronous stack traces for languages and tools to allow debuggers to show them.To see a full list of changes to APIs, proceed to theGraalVM Truffle changelog.",

          "title": "20.2.0",
          "content": "20.2.0(2020-08-18)Java  GraalVM Community Edition is based on OpenJDK version 1.8.0_262 and OpenJDK version 11.0.8.  Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition is based on Oracle JDK version 1.8.0_261 and Oracle JDK version 11.0.8.0.2. You can find Oracle JDK release notes for these versions at the Oracle Technology Network website. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Added the ability to release the memory used by libgraal to the OS when an application enters a stable phase and compilation goes idle. This is achieved by attaching each compiler thread to a libgraal isolate. The number of compiler threads that can be attached to an isolate is controlled by the jvmci.ThreadsPerNativeLibraryRuntime system property. The default is all threads attached to a single isolate. Isolates are initialized on demand to handle extra compiler threads. When a compiler thread becomes idle (idleness delay is configurable by jvmci.CompilerIdleDelay), it detaches itself from its isolate. As the last thread detaches from an isolate, it is shutdown and its memory (i.e., the libgraal heap) is released to the OS. This feature has the following of advantages:          It can reduce the RSS memory footprint of a GraalVM process. If the compiler is not being used, it uses no resources.      If multiple isolates are used, it mitigates interference between complier threads. For example, there is less contention on shared objects and a garbage collection in one isolate will not pause threads in other isolates. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)        Improved the optimization responsible for removing redundant read/write, array clone() and accesses to the cloned arrays operations. Workloads that heavily use array read/write operations, especially inside loops, in combination with allocations may benefit from this optimization. As a result of the enhanced read/write optimization, the speedups of up to 2.5x on the JetStream benchmarks were seen with GraalVM JavaScript engine. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Added an experimental partial loop unrolling optimization. Partial loop unrolling is an extended form of traditional loop unrolling optimization that works for arbitrary counted loops with an unknown upper bound of loop iterations i. The optimization is not enabled by default, you can experiment with the optimization by enabling it with -Dgraal.EnterprisePartialUnroll=true. Note, the optimization is still experimental and thus may lead to unknown errors. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Fixed an error in code generation which was leading to incorrect behaviour of programs using the Apache commons-compress BZip2 implementation (see #2534).  Improved excessive compile time of certain programs (see #2548).  Improved error reporting with libgraal. Fatal errors in libgraal now produce a hs-err crash log that can substantially improve triaging and debugging such errors. Likewise, low level libgraal output, such as libgraal GC messages produced by -Dlibgraal.PrintGC=true are routed to HotSpot’s log stream. That is, libgraal error handling and logging is unified with HotSpot support for these features and thus configurable by options such as -XX:LogFile and -XX:OnError.  Renamed the MitigateSpeculativeExecutionAttacks compiler option to SpectrePHTBarriers (e.g., use -Dgraal.SpectrePHTBarriers=AllTargets for java or --vm.Dgraal.SpectrePHTBarriers=AllTargets for js).Native Image  Improved the G1GC-like garbage collection for workloads where Native Image requires smaller GC pauses. More details are in the documentation on how to enable and configure it documentation on how to enable and configure it. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Added an option to create “mostly static” native images which link statically everything except libc. Native images built this way are convenient to use in small docker images, for example, based on distroless/static. Enable nearly static native image generation with the following option: -H:+StaticExecutableWithDynamicLibC.  Improved generation of native images statically linked against muslc. If you have musl-gcc on the path, you can now generate a native image statically linked against muslc with the following options: --static --libc=musl. More information about this is available in the documentation.  Enabled -H:+RemoveSaturatedTypeFlows by default, which should result in faster native image generation and use less memory for the generation.  Changed the class initialization strategy to initialize at build time only a small part of the JDK library. To get the previous behaviour back, use --initialize-at-build-time option for necessary packages.  Many other improvements and bug fixes can be found in the repository.JavaScript  Updated Node.js to version 12.18.0. Notable changes in this release are available from the Node.JS project website.  Updated ICU4J library to version 67.1.  Implemented the Intl.NumberFormat Unified API proposal.  Implemented the Logical Assignment Operators proposal.  Implemented the Top-level Await proposal.  Implemented the Promise.any proposal. It is available in ECMAScript 2021 mode (--js.ecmascript-version=2021).  Implemented support for async stack traces.  Fixed Date.toLocaleString and Intl.DateTimeFormat to use the context’s default time zone rather than the system default if no explicit time zone is requested.  Improved js.timezone option to validate the time zone ID and support zone offsets like “-07:00”.Updates for Language and Tool Implementers  Enabled by default the new inlining heuristic in which inlining budgets are based on Graal IR node counts and not on Truffle Node counts. More information can be found in the Inlining guide.  Added support for subclassing DynamicObject so that guest languages can directly base their object class hierarchy on it, add fields and use @ExportLibrary on subclasses.  Added new DynamicObjectLibrary API for accessing and mutating properties and the shape of DynamicObject instances. More information can be found in the Dynamic Object Model guide.  Added new identity APIs to InteropLibrary:          hasIdentity(Object receiver) to find out whether an object specifies identity      isIdentical(Object receiver, Object other, InteropLibrary otherLib) to compare the identity of two object      isIdenticalOrUndefined(Object receiver, Object other) to specify the identity of an object      identityHashCode(Object receiver) to implement maps that depend on identity        Added Truffle DSL @Bind annotation to common out expression for use in guards and specialization methods.  Added the ability to disable adoption for DSL cached expressions with type node using @Cached(value =&quot;...&quot;, weak = true).  Added an option not to adopt the parameter annotated by @Cached, using @Cached(value =&quot;...&quot;, adopt = false).  Added CompilerDirectives.shouldNotReachHere() as a short-cut for languages to indicate that a path should not be reachable neither in compiled nor interpreted code paths.More details are available from the changelog.Updates for Polyglot Embedders  Added Context.parse(Source) to parse but not evaluate a source. Parsing the source allows to trigger e.g., syntax validation prior to executing the code.  Added PolyglotException.isResourceExhausted() to determine if an error was caused by a resource limit (e.g., OutOfMemoryError) that was exceeded.  Added a factory method creating a FileSystem based on the host Java NIO. The obtained instance can be used as a delegate in a decorating filesystem.  Added optional FileSystem.isSameFile method testing if the given paths refer to the same physical file. The method can be overridden by the FileSystem implementer with a more efficient test.More details are available from the changelog.ToolingVS Code  Updated Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation to support the latest protocol version 3.15.  Updated VSCode extension by merging into one. More details about Visual Studio Code Extension.  Added showing code coverage from GraalVM LSP in VS Code.VisualVM  Updated VisualVM to use NetBeans platform 11.3.  Added GoToSource from VisualVM to your preferred IDE.Ideal Graph Visualizer  Implemented usability improvements for graphs identification in IGV (IGV graph now displays a dump ID and a user label with Graph name). (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Added Go To Type and Attach Debugger actions.  IGV updated to NetBeans platform to 11.3.LLVM Runtime  Added support for InteropLibrary.isIdentical and related messages.  Added the --print-toolchain-api-identifier, --print-toolchain-api-tool &amp;lt;tool-name&amp;gt; and --print-toolchain-api-paths &amp;lt;path-name&amp;gt; arguments to the lli launcher. These can be used to query the Toolchain API from the command line.  Added support for requesting locations via the #getPaths() method to the Java API of the Toolchain. For example, the location of the toolchain executables or libraries.  Added llvm/api/toolchain.h header for accessing the Toolchain from C code.  Added ability to read and write bigger values to a polyglot i8 array. For example, when reading an i64 from a foreign value that is typed as i8 array, the LLVM runtime will read 8 i8 values and combine them to an i64 result.  Removed the --llvm.sourcePath option (deprecated since 19.0). Use --inspect.SourcePath instead.  Removed support for the application/x-llvm-ir-bitcode-base64 mime-type (deprecated since 19.0).Python  Improved reference counting for native extensions to prevent memory leaks.  Added code serialization to .pyc files (.pyc files persistently store the Python bytecode compiled from the source .py files).  Fixed warning in pandas about size of the datetime objects.  Improved compatibility (more CPython unittests pass for core types).  Added support for parsing requests with arguments for embedding Python.  Added support for the basic usage of tox – a Python testing wrapper.  Removed support for iterables as arrays in polyglot applications.  Added a faster implementation of _struct. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)R  Improved SVG support activated with the --R.UseInternalGridGraphics=false flag.  Improved FastR user experience: FastR should have no requirements on both Linux and macOS i.e., installing GCC or GFortran should not be necessary to run FastR, but it may be necessary to install some third party R packages.RubyNew features:  Updated to Ruby 2.6.6.  Configured Ruby to always show core library files in backtraces.  The Java stacktrace is now shown when sending SIGQUIT to the process, also on TruffleRuby Native, see Debugging for details.  Use InteropLibrary#toDisplayString() to better display objects from other languages.  foreign_object.to_s now uses InteropLibrary#toDisplayString() (and still asString() if isString()).  foreign_object.inspect has been improved to be more useful (include the language and meta object).  foreign_object.name = value will now call Interoplibrary#writeMember(&quot;name&quot;, value) instead of invokeMember(&quot;name=&quot;, value).  Calls to foreign objects with a block argument will now pass the block as the last argument.  foreign.name will now use invokeMember if invocable and if not use readMember. See doc/contrib/interop_implicit_api.md for details.Bug fixes:  Fix #class_exec, #module_exec, #instance_eval, and instance_exec to use activated refinements (@ssnickolay).  Use upgraded default gems when installed.  The output for --engine.TraceCompilation is now significantly easier to read, by having shorter method names and source names.  Fixed indentation for squiggly heredoc syntax with single quotes.  Fixed missing flushing when printing an exception at top-level with a custom backtrace, which caused no output to be shown.Compatibility:  Implemented Ripper by using the C extension.  Implemented ObjectSpace::WeakMap.  Supported #refine for Module (@ssnickolay).  Fixed refine + super compatibility (@ssnickolay)  Implemented UnboundMethod#bind_call.  RUBY_REVISION is now the full commit hash used to build TruffleRuby, similar to MRI 2.7+.  Changed the lookup methods to achieve Refinements specification (@ssnickolay)Performance:  Enabled lazy translation from the parser AST to the Truffle AST for user code by default. This should improve application startup time.  instance variable ... not initialized and similar warnings are now optimized to have no peak performance impact if they are not printed (depends on $VERBOSE).  Implemented integer modular exponentiation using BigInteger#mod_pow ( @skateman).  Fixed a performance issue when computing many substrings of a given non-leaf String with non-US-ASCII characters.  Speedup native handle to Ruby object lookup for C extensions.Changes:  RubyGems gem commands updated to use the --no-document option by default.",

Enhanced the upgrading policies to prevent components not being upgraded when migrating from GraalVM Community to GraalVM Enterprise Edition (gu upgrade --edition ee).  Improved handling the license acceptance by gu when a user is prompted to accept “Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition Native Image License”.20.3.1(2021-01-19)GraalVM Community Edition 20.3.1 is a Critical Patch Update (CPU) release.It is based on OpenJDK CPU and includes all the OpenJDK security fixes released as part of that CPU.It is a full distribution and supersedes the previous release of GraalVM Community 20.3.0.It also includes the following:  Update to OpenJDK version 8u282 for Java 8-based GraalVM Community, please see please see OpenJDK 8u282 Updates.  Update to OpenJDK version 11.0.10 for Java 11-based GraalVM Community, please see OpenJDK 11.0.10 Updates.20.3.0(2020-11-17)Java  GraalVM Community Edition is based on OpenJDK version 1.8.0_272 and OpenJDK version 11.0.9.  Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition is based on Oracle JDK version 1.8.0_271 and Oracle JDK version 11.0.9. You canfind Oracle JDK release notes for these versions at the Oracle Technology Network website.  Improved eliminating or delaying class loading from libgraal until after itsinitialization. This improves performance on workloads with very shortiterations (in milliseconds). It also fixes problems related to VM assumptionsabout the JIT compiler not loading classes, which could lead to races andsometimes deadlocks.  Improved conditional move optimization: GraalVM Enterprise contains an optimization that uses the CPU’sconditional move (CMOV) instruction to implement certain conditionalstatements. In this release we have improved this optimization to give higherand more predictable performance for workloads sensitive to conditional moveinstructions. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Improved heuristics in GraalVM Enterprise for loop peeling optimization for workloads where the first iterationinitializes array objects lazily. This is a common pattern in GraalVM’s Pythonruntime of Python iterators. It results in performance improvements for microPython benchmarks of up to 40%. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Improved code generated by GraalVM Enterprise for initializing newly allocated arrays, fixing a performance issuewhere large array allocations were initialized twice. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Improved the heuristics for the code duplication optimization in GraalVM Enterprise which gives a peak performanceimprovement of up to 17% on some LLVM workloads and a 5% increase on some Javaworkloads. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)Native image  Improved container awareness: on Linux, the resource limits - processor count,memory size -  are read from cgroup V1 and V2 configurations. The processorcount can also be overridden on the command line using the option-XX:ActiveProcessorCount=.  Improved the “isolated compilation” that separates applications and theruntime compiler from each other, which improves performance by reducinginterference between them, for example, due to garbage collection.  The G1 garbage collector now also supportsnative images that use runtime-compiled code. It can be enabled at image buildtime using the option --gc=G1. G1 support is currently limited to Linux onAMD64. Windows and macOS support will be available in future releases. G1 nowalso supports performance counters (when the image is built with-H:+AllowVMInspection). (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Improved the options to enable and disable assertions which now support the fullsyntax to specify package and class names. Assertions need to be configured atimage build time, using the options -ea / -da / -esa / -dsa. Thedefinition of “system assertions” is expanded to not only include assertions inthe JDK, but also in the Native Image runtime system, for example, in the garbagecollector implementation.  Added basic debug information generation on Windows (developed in collaboration with Red Hat).  Added many small performance and memory footprint optimizations. In particular,a new implementation of type checks improves the performance ofClass.isInstance and Class.isAssignableFrom with less type data in the imageheap.  Added support for method handles that represent a call to a single methodaccessible by the Reflection API, with no transformations applied through theMethod Handles API, such as calls to MethodHandle.bindTo() orMethodHandle.asType(). To enable this feature use--report-unsupported-elements-at-runtime.  Many other bug fixes and improvements which can be found in the GitHub repository.Updates for Language and Tool Implementers  Enabled by default the elastic allocation of the compiler threads dependingon the number of available processors, in both JVM and native modes. The oldbehaviour, 1 or 2 compiler threads, can be explicitly enabled with--engine.CompilerThreads=0.  Added ThreadsActivationListener to listen to the thread enter and leave events in instruments.  Added new flags to inspect the expansion during partial evaluation:--engine.TraceMethodExpansion=truffleTier,--engine.TraceNodeExpansion=truffleTier,--engine.MethodExpansionStatistics=truffleTier and--engine.NodeExpansionStatistics=truffleTier. Language implementations areencouraged to run with these flags enabled and investigate their output forunexpected results. See Optimizing.md for details.  Added TruffleInstrument.Env.getOptions(TruffleContext) to retrieve contextspecific options for an instrument and TruffleInstrument.getContextOptions()to describe them. This is useful if an instrument wants to be configured percontext.  Added the ability to create context and context thread locals in languages and instruments. See ContextLocal and ContextThreadLocal classes for details.  Added NodeLibrary, which provides guest language information associated with aparticular Node location, the local scope mainly and TruffleLanguage.getScopeand TruffleInstrument.Env.getScope, which provides a top scope object of a guestlanguage.  Added ByteArraySupport: a helper class providing safe multi-byte primitive type accesses from byte arrays.  Added a new base class for the exceptions, see AbstractTruffleException. The original TruffleException has been deprecated. Added new interop messages for exception handling replacing the deprecated TruffleException methods.  Added new specialization utility to print detailed statistics about specialization instances and execution count. See Specialization Statistics for details on how to use it.  More details are available from the changelog.Updates for Polyglot Embedders  Added Context.interrupt(Duration) to interrupt a polyglot Context execution. The interrupt is non-destructive meaning that the polyglot Context can still be used for further execution.  Added the ability to specify a TargetMappingPrecedence of target type mappings for HostAccess configurations that influence conversion order and precedence in relation to default mappings and other target type mappings.  Added a log.file option that allows redirection of all languages, instrument or engine logging to a file. The handler configured with the Context.Builder.logHandler method has precedence over the new option.  Added experimental sandbox resource limits for languages implemented on top of the Truffle language implementation framework. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  More details are available from the changelog.JavaScript  Updated Node.js to version 12.18.4.  Fixed field/getter/setter access order in a Nashorn compatibility mode, see #343.  Fixed “Multiple applicable overloads found” error in a Nashorn compatibility mode, see #286.  Enabled low precedence lossy number, string-to-boolean, and number-to-boolean conversions in a Nashorn compatibility mode.  Fixed Java.extend to respect HostAccess.Builder.allowImplementations, see #294.  Added Java host interoperability support for mapping JavaScript objects to abstract classes (if HostAccess allows it).  Added js.foreign-object-prototype as a supported option to set JavaScript prototypes for foreign objects mimicing JavaScript types. It was renamed from js.experimental-foreign-object-prototype.  Changed ToPrimitive abstract operation to follow the specification for foreign objects. InteropLibrary.toDisplayString is not used by ToPrimitive/ToString conversions anymore.Ruby  Added handling foreign null object as falsy value (#1902).  Improve reliability of the post install hook by disabling RubyGems (#2075).  Fixed the top level exception handler to print exception cause (#2013).  Fixed handling of post arguments for super() (#2111).  Fixed constant/identifier detection in lexer for non-ASCII encodings (#2079, #2102).  Fixed parsing of --jvm as an application argument (#2108).  Added checking bounds for FFI::Pointer accesses when the size of the memory behind is known.  Implemented negative line numbers for eval (#1482).  Migrated from JLine 2 to JLine 3 for the readline standard library.  Added various warmup improvements, notably much less splitting and more operations are done inline, without a call.  Improved setting and access to the special variables $~ and $_ which has been refactored to require less splitting.  More details are available from the changelog.R  Improved compatibility with a preliminary implementation of the ALTREP framework: http://homepage.stat.uiowa.edu/~luke/talks/uiowa-2018.pdf  Exposed native function match5, which is necessary for R package fastmatch.  Added a few more smaller compatibility fixes and implemented missing APIs.  More details are available from the changelog.Python  Updated Python to version 3.8.5.  Added the experimental new HPy native API, so it is possible run piconumpy through HPy now.  The standalone graalpython version can now be installed through pyenv.  Many fixes to pass the unittests of standard library types and modules:complex, bytes, bytearray, subclassing of special descriptors, type layouts, float, generators, modules, argument passing corner cases, string literals and encodings, import and importlib, decimal, glob, the builtin module, json, math, operator, numeric tower, sys, warnings, random, f-strings, struct, itertools, super.LLVM runtime  Added support for code sharing in the GraalVM LLVM runtime. This allows the AST and compiled code of common bitcode libraries to be shared between multiple contexts within a single engine improving performance.  Updated LLVM toolchain to version 10.0.0.  Improved for va_list / varargs handling across language boundaries. Using va_start in an LLVM function that was called from a foreign language no longer forces all arguments into native memory. The resulting va_list object can be passed to code written in other languages, and accessed there using standard interop APIs.  Introduced the Handles API for storing managed pointers in native memory.  Moved polyglot.h to graalvm/llvm/polyglot.h and llvm/api/toolchain.h to graalvm/llvm/toolchain-api.h. The old header locations are deprecated, and will be removed in a future release.  Renamed libpolyglot-mock.so to libgraalvm-llvm.so. The old name is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.ToolingVisual Studio Code Extensions  Enhanced a VSCode GraalVM Extension with:          Java syntax highlighting      Java code completion      Installation wizard to download and install GraalVM Community or GraalVM Enterprise from the UI      Integrated Java debugger with all the features you would expect from a full featured IDE debugger like the Netbeans IDE      Integrated Polyglot debugger allowing to debug Javascript, Python, R, Ruby and other GraalVM languages        Implemented a VS Code Micronaut extension which:          Leverages all the great features of the Graal VS Code Extension for Java      Includes a Micronaut project wizard for creating new Micronaut applications      Includes Gradle and Maven support      Includes support to easily create a native executable from a Micronaut Gradle application using GraalVM Native Image      GraalVM Dashboard  Re-implemented GraalVM Dashboard with OracleJET.

Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition is based on Oracle JDK version 1.8.0_281 and Oracle JDK version 11.0.10. You can find Oracle JDK release notes for these versions at Oracle Java SE Downloads.Java on Truffle  Added an experimental Java Virtual Machine implementation based on a Truffle interpreter. Read more here.Container ImagesGraalVM Community images for Docker containers changed the location and now are available from GitHub Container Registry. See the guide.Platforms SupportAs of this version, we provide GraalVM distributions for Linux on AArch64 system.All components including the GraalVM core are experimental.GraalVM Enterprise Edition is based on Oracle JDK11 for AArch64, and GraalVM Community Edition on OpenJDK 11 for AArch64 architecture accordingly.Native Image  Added serialization support for Native Image. The serialization support ensures constructors for classes are contained in a native image, so that they can be deserialized in the first place. These classes should be whitelisted in an additional specific configuration file, similar to the Reflection continuation, as some classes cannot be deserialized, including classes that might be part of the native image, but not listed in the configuration file. You can either create a configuration file manually or apply a Tracing Agent, provided with GraalVM, to help writing the configuration files.  Added method handle invocation support for Native Image (see #2761). Methods and fields accessed through method handles have to be registered in the Reflection configuration file. Also added method handles support to the Tracing agent to automatically generate the configuration for the native image build. Most use cases of method handles are supported. VarHandles that are not stored in static fields are still not supported.  Added AWT and Swing support for the Linux platform (configuration collection with the Tracing agent is necessary).  Added the experimental -H:+InlineBeforeAnalysis option to reduce the number of required configuration entries and lessen the image size.  Improved the Tracing agent: it now captures instances of Class.getClasses and Class.getDeclaredClasses.  Improved the ServiceLoaderFeature class to scan for services declared using modules.  Disallowed the instances of Random in the native image heap.  Improved GC performance (less time spent in GC).Updates for Language and Tool Implementers Using Truffle API  Fixed many issues related to multi-tier compilation. Multi-tier compilation (--engine.MultiTier) will be enabled by default in 21.1.  Added HostCompilerDirectives for directives that guide the host compilations of the Truffle interpreters:  HostCompilerDirectives.BytecodeInterpreterSwitchto denote methods that contain the instruction-dispatch switch in bytecode interpreters  HostCompilerDirectives.BytecodeInterpreterSwitchBoundary to denote methods that do not need to be inlined into the bytecode interpreter switch  Truffle DSL generated nodes are no longer limited to 64 state bits. Use these state bits responsibly.  More changes are listed in the changelog.Updates for Polyglot Embedders  Added support for explicitly selecting a host method overload using the signature in the form of comma-separated fully qualified parameter type names enclosed by parentheses (e.g., methodName(f.q.TypeName,java.lang.String,int,int[])).  Deprecated the host method selection by JNI mangled signature, replaced by the aforementioned new form. Scheduled for removal in 21.2.JavaScript  Updated Node.js to version 12.20.1.  Enabled the following ECMAScript 2021 mode/features by default:          Class fields      Promise.any      String.prototype.replaceAll      Logical Assignment Operators        Adopted a new interop exception handling and made JS exceptions extend the AbstractTruffleException class.  Exposed Graal.versionECMAScript instead of Graal.versionJS.  Implemented the relative indexing method proposal. It is available in ECMAScript 2022 mode (--js.ecmascript-version=2022).Python  Added the jarray module for compatiblity with Jython.  Improved the support for Pandas and added the initial support for the Matplotlib visualization library.  Provided fixes to avoid possible memory leaks and crashes when running NumPy in a shared engine.  Fixed an infinite continuation prompt in REPL when pasting snippets.More details can be found in the changelog.Ruby  The new IRB is quite slow when copy/paste code into it. This is due to an inefficient io/console implementation which will be addressed in the next release. A workaround is to use irb --readline, which disables some IRB features but is much faster for copy/pasting code.New features:  Updated to Ruby 2.7.2. Most Ruby 2.7 features and changes are implemented (see #2004).Bug fixes:  Fixed setting of special variables in enumerators and enumerables (issue #1484).  Fixed issue with Method#to_proc and special variable storage (issue #2156).Compatibility:  **kwargs now accept non-Symbol keys like Ruby 2.7.Performance:  Refactor and implement more performant MatchData#length (see #2147).  Refactor and implement more performant Array#sample (see #2148).  String#inspect is now more efficient.Changes:  All InteropLibrary messages are now exposed consistently as methods on Truffle::Interop (see #2139). Some methods were renamed to match the scheme described in the documentation.  More details are available from the changelog.R  Fixed AssertionError when trying to install the R validate package (issue #169).LLVM runtime  Improved the AST sharing, and support for the auxiliary engine caching. On top of the regular AST sharing that allows sharing code between multiple contexts in a single engine, this allows persisting of shared code across process boundaries.  Added support for the current major release of macOS (macOS Big Sur).Deprecations:  Added a deprecation warning for the old header files locations polyglot.h and llvm/api/toolchain.h. These header files have been already deprecated in 20.3.0, but without a warning.GraalWasm  This release included a large number of bugfixes in semantics, linking and in-module validation. GraalVM’s WebAssembly interpreter now passes almost all tests from the official specification test suite.  Exposed Polyglot bindings that are needed for the JS-to-WebAssembly Interface API.  Optimized the GraalWasm interpreter, leading to warmup and an overall 20x peak performance improvement of the interpreted execution mode.  Improved the security by using the byte-buffer-based memory instead of the off-heap memory.ToolingGraalVM UpdaterStarting from version 21.0, GraalVM Updater has become more powerful and can be used to update your GraalVM local installation to a newer version or upgrade from a Community to Enterprise Edition.

Windows platform compatibility: To run GraalVM Community Edition based on OpenJDK 8u292 on a Windows platform, the MSVCR100.dll redistributable package needs to be installed (for more details, see the issue #3187).Compiler  Added support to detect inverted (tail counted) loops as counted loops. GraalVM Enterprise now detects such loops as counted, enabling them to be analyzed and optimized like all other counted loops. These loops are subject to full unrolling, partial unrolling, guard optimization and vectorization. This new capability can be disabled with -Dgraal.DetectInvertedLoopsAsCounted=false. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Added a novel loop inversion optimization in GraalVM Enterprise. This adds compiler support to generate inverted loops from regular ones. Inverted loops have superior characteristics for instruction level parallelism and optimization capabilities compared to regular, head counted loops. We have seem performance improvements of up to 30% for micro benchmarks exercising the inverted loop shape. Loop inversion is on by default and can be disabled with -Dgraal.LoopInversion=false. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Added a new optimization that analyzes code guarded by a conditional of the form x == y and replace all uses of x with y (or vice versa) if the replacement results in potential for further optimization. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Enhanced SIMD vectorization, to support vector byte reversal (e.g., Integer.reverseBytes). SIMD vectorization is still experimental and not enabled by default. Enable it with -Dgraal.VectorizeSIMD=true. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Added support for vectorizing hashCode-like loops using the hash = c * hash + array[i]. Disable with -Dgraal.VectorizeHashes=false. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Eliminated the cast of the loaded array element to Node, to prevent the situation when volatile fields are loading from arrays, losing type information about the element, and resulting in unneeded casts. This method in ConcurrentHashMap can be an example:     static final &amp;lt;K,V&amp;gt; Node&amp;lt;K,V&amp;gt; tabAt(Node&amp;lt;K,V&amp;gt;[] tab, int i) {      return (Node&amp;lt;K,V&amp;gt;)U.getObjectVolatile(tab, ((long)i &amp;lt;&amp;lt; ASHIFT) + ABASE);  }    Eliminate unneeded memory barriers on sequential volatile writes on x86. There are patterns in classes such as ConcurrentHashMap where numerous volatile writes can occur in a sequence (after inlining). The GraalVM compiler now omits the memory barrier for all but the last write in the sequence, speeding up methods such as ConcurrentHashMap.transfer.Native Image  Improved support for localization. Now you can specify which locales should be included in the native executable, and which should be the default. Forexample, to switch the default locale to German and also include French and English, use -H:DefaultLocale=de -H:IncludeLocales=fr,en. All locales can be included via -H:+IncludeAllLocales.  Deprecated the --enable-all-security-services option as it is no longer necessary. Security services are now registered automatically when found in use by static analysis.  Improved support on Windows: applications now do file globbing on parameters.  Added reporting on the native image build to produce multiple artifacts. Results of the build are written to the imagename.build_artifacts.txt file.  Fixed a bug on Linux and macOS that resulted in local symbols about all methods being included in the native image, when -g is passed for debug information generation. Method symbols are not necessary for debugging because the Dwarf debugging information also contains this information. When local symbols are desired, e.g., for certain profilers, they can be included in the image using -H:-DeleteLocalSymbols (independently of the -g option).  Allowed multiple different native images in the same process, e.g., an application and a shared library. This was required for Linux platforms.  Automatically mark more classes for build-time initializaiton. This reduces the overhead of class initialization at run time.Polyglot Runtime  Enabled multi-tier compilation by default. This feature was first introduced in 20.3 as an experimental option. Truffle now uses two tiers of compilation. The first tier is optimized for compilation speed and reuses the GraalVM compiler economy configuration to perform speedy compilations with method inlining of trivial methods only. The second tier compiles with all GraalVM’s compiler optimizations enabled and is performed after the first tier compilation is completed. Our benchmark results show that this improves warmup for most languages significantly.  Added new capabilities for language implementations that require an optional dependency to the newest JVMCI version 21.1-b02 (issue JDK-8263776). In the next release, 21.2 we plan to use some of these capabilities for core runtime functionality, and therefore JVMCI 21.1-b02 will become a required dependency. This will make runtime compilation for JDK releases that do not support JVMCI 21.1-b02 unsupported. Note that all Truffle languages can still be executed on any JDK but without support for runtime compilation.   Introduced new experimental flags to set the compilation thresholds for multi-tier compilation: --engine.FirstTierCompilationThreshold sets the threshold for the first, and --engine.LastTierCompilationThreshold for the second tier. If multi-tier compilation is disabled, --engine.SingleTierCompilationThreshold=x may be used. The original option, --engine.CompilationThreshold, is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  Added a new experimental compilation queue implementation inspired by HotSpot. The implementation is not yet enabled by default, but can be tried out using the --engine.TraversingCompilationQueue option. The flag is expected to reduce warmup time. More changes and enhancements are planned for the next release, where it is expected to become the default implementation.  Deprecated the --engine.CompilationThreshold option. Use --engine.FirstTierCompilationThreshold and --engine.LastTierCompilationThreshold instead.Java on Truffle  Introduced many fixes and improvements to the Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) support. Many edge cases have been fixed which increased the performance of Java on Truffle while debugging is enabled (up to 200x!).  Provided fixes for method redefinition: reflective access and MethodHandles now follow method changes.  Added support for signal handlers (sun.misc.Signal / jdk.internal.misc.Signal). This means shutdown hooks are now run when closing a program with Ctrl-C.  Removed the dependency on deprecated Scope API and implement newly introduced NodeLibrary instead.  Fixed guest stack traces as reported by the GraalVM embedder API (PolyglotException).  Improved support for restricting thread creation.JavaScript  Updated Node.js to version 14.16.1.  Node.js support is not enabled by default and must be installed explicitly with GraalVM Updater if needed: gu install nodejs. The JavaScript runtime continue to be included in the base GraalVM installation.  Added Iterator interoperability support. It allows JavaScript iterators to be used via the Value API (hasIterator(), getIterator(), hasIteratorNextElement(), getIteratorNextElement()), as well as iterable objects from other languages to be iterated in GraalVM’s JavaScript runtime (e.g., via for-of loops), and vice versa.  Enabled buffer interoperability support. It allows host ByteBuffers and buffers from other languages to be used with JavaScript typed arrays (e.g., new Uint8Array(foreignBuffer)) and DataView, without copying. It also enables access to ArrayBuffers via the Value API (readBuffer*, writeBuffer*).  Implemented the experimental version of the WebAssembly JavaScript Interface, which allows invoking WebAssembly programs from within JavaScript programs (available behind the --js.webassembly option).The changelog is available in the project repository.LLVM Runtime (Sulong)  The ability to build GraalVM or a native image with “native mode” completely removed (so only --llvm.managed mode works). (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Made pointers to foreign “buffer-like” objects (e.g., JS ArrayBuffer) be transparently accessed like native buffers.  Added support for loading bitcode modules with regular dlopen in addition to the Polyglot API.   Added experimental support for the Linux AArch64 platform.  Implemented a sanity check to verify that loaded bitcode files are compiled correctly for the GraalVM LLVM Runtime. In particular, this will fail when loading bitcode that is built for managed mode and used in native mode, or vice versa. This can be turned into a non-fatal warning with the --llvm.verifyBitcode=false option.The project changelog is available on GitHub.Ruby  Implemented more complete support of Ruby 2.7 (see #2004 for more details).  Multi-tier compilation is now enabled by default, which improves warmup significantly.  C extensions which link to a static library now generally work by prepending the GraalVM LLVM toolchain to PATH when installing gems.  Improved the performance of checks for recursion (#2189).  Improved random number generation performance by avoiding synchronization (#2190).  Implemented the ability to create a single call target per block by default instead of two.  Optimized some uses of class variables (#2259).  Speeded up the interpreter and reduced footprint by making several methods that need the caller frame  always inlined in their caller.  Added support for accessing local variables of the interactive Binding via language bindings: context.getBindings(&quot;ruby&quot;).putMember(&quot;my_var&quot;, 42);. See #2030.  Made signal handlers run without triggering multi-threading.  Implemented the Debug Inspector C API.  Switched to the io-console C extension for better performance and compatibility in irb.  Updated to irb 1.3.3 and reline 0.2.3 which allow pasting code in IRB reasonably fast (#2233).  Standalone builds of TruffleRuby are now based on JDK11 (they used JDK8 previously).More details are available from the TruffleRuby changelog.Python  Improved support for Java subclassing and  new Interoperability APIs for better Jython migration path. The features often requested and available with Jython, like convenient iteration over Python types from Java, implementing Java abstract classes and interfaces from Python, catching and re-throwing Java exceptions in Python code, are now provided with GraalVM’s Python runtime as well, making the migration easier.  Added the SSL support. This allows out-of-the-box installation of Python packages. Now users can run the Python pip installer to download Python packages, and their dependencies, just as they would on CPython.  Added a completely native backend for posix API. This provides better performance and more compatibility for filesystem access.  Added support for multi-threading with GIL. Multi-threading is supported in GraalVM’s Python runtime to the same extent as CPython. That is, there is only concurrency, not parallelism for most workloads.  Added support for the current HPy Python C API to run C extensions at better performance. This is an ongoing research project together with members of the PyPy project and the University of Cape Town to provide a faster API for NumPy and other popular Python C extensions.More details are available in the project changelog.R  Upgraded GraalVM’s R runtime to R 4.0.3:          Made the GraalVM R runtime mostly compatible with R 4.0.3;      Migrated to new versions of the base and recommended packages;      Implemented some of the new features of R 4.0.3 (see the changelog for a complete list).        Upgraded the CRAN snapshot, used by default by install.packages, to 2021-02-01:          Support of the new versions of some of the most popular packages on GraalVM’s R runtime is a work in progress;      Packages with known issues remain: dplyr 1.0.3, ggplot 3.3.3, knitr 1.31.      More details are available in the project changelog.WebAssembly (GraalWasm)  Substantially improved the speedup and the overall peak performance of the GraalWasm interpreter by over 10x.  Provided the basic WASI functions that allow manipulating the files and accessing the file system through the Truffle filesystem layer.   GraalWasm is now passing most of the tests in the official WebAssembly test suite.  Improved the speed of the standalone GraalWasm launcher, and the peak performance overall.  Implemented the WebAssembly-JavaScript Interface specification, which allows invoking WebAssembly programs from within JavaScript programs running on GraalVM’s JavaScript runtime.  Implemented parsing custom name sections in the .wasm files to make stack-traces more user-friendly.  Made the GraalWasm interpreter  respect the binary-validation rules.  Introduced checks for memory/table/function count limits when parsing and linking binaries, as defined in the specification.  Added checks to not get exponential compilation slowdown on some pathological code examples.ToolsVisual Studio Code Extensions  Added results visualization for unit tests:  Improved Micronaut support by adding YAML &amp;lt;&amp;gt; Java code editing features:  Added a number of refactorings.  Included Micronaut projects Docker build commands.  Improved support for Maven and Gradle multi-project builds.VisualVM  Added support for upcoming JDK 16 (#260).  Added support for the new Apple M1 processor (aarch64) (#262).  Added support for the importation of plugins from the previous release (#270).  Added a display list of enabled modules in heap dumps feature, taken from JDK 9+ created by jlink (#275).Polyglot Embedding  Added a new experimental sandbox option --sandbox.MaxHeapMemory=&amp;lt;size&amp;gt; that specifies the maximum heap memory that a guest application can retain during its run. This feature is currently only supported on HotSpot. Note that this feature is still experimental. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Added support for byte buffer-like data structures. This release adds new methods to access buffer values like Value.hasBufferElements(). Java host interoperability was improved to handle java.nio.ByteBuffer implementations to make them work like native guest language buffers. This feature can be enabled and disabled using HostAccess.Builder.allowBufferAccess(boolean). Support for polyglot buffers in languages may vary. See the individual language changelog for more details.  Added support for iterable and iterator-like data structures. This includes new methods to detect if a polyglot value is an iterator or iterable with Value.isIterator() and Value.hasIterator(). New proxy interfaces ProxyIterator and ProxyIterable were added to mimic iterators and iterables. Java host interoperability was improved to handle java.util.Iterator and java.util.Iterable implementations to make them work like guest language values. This feature can be enabled and disabled with HostAccess.Builder.allowIteratorAccess(boolean) and HostAccess.Builder.allowIterableAccess(boolean). Guest language iterators can now also be mapped to Java iterators using Value.as(Iterator.class). The support for this feature in individual languages may vary. See the language changelog for more details.  Added support for map-like data structures (issue #143). This includes new methods for polyglot values like Value.hasHashEntries() to query if a polyglot value represents a hash map like data structure. A new interface ProxyHashMap was added to mimic such values. Java host interoperability was improved to handle java.util.Map implementations to make them look like guest language hash maps. This feature can be enabled and disabled with HostAccess.Builder.allowMapAccess(boolean). Guest language maps can now also be mapped to Java Maps using Value.as(Map.class). The support for this feature in individual languages may vary. See the language changelog for more details.  Added Context.safepoint() to cooperatively poll thread local actions of a polyglot context while a host method is executed. For example, this allows the context to check for interruption or cancellation.A detailed list of all the changes can be found in the changelog.Truffle Language and Tool Implementations  Added support for submitting thread local actions to run at guest language safepoints for language implementations (issue JDK-8263776). Please see the tutorial on how to adapt and use this feature in a language or tool implementation.  Added a new interoperability trait for buffer elements in InteropLibrary that allows better integration with native buffers.  Added a new interoperability type iterator and a new trait for iterable in InteropLibrary to improve traversal of collections between languages.  Added a new interoperability trait for hash entries in InteropLibrary to improve interoperability between guest language hash maps (issue #143).  Added TruffleInstrument.Env.calculateContextHeapSize(TruffleContext, long, AtomicBoolean) to calculate the heap size retained by a context.  Added @GenerateAOT to support preparation for AOT specializing nodes. Read the AOT tutorial to get started with Truffle and AOT compilation. We also added the --engine.CompileAOTOnCreate option to trigger AOT compilation on call target create. More changes and enhancements are planned for the next release.  Added ExactMath.truncate(float) and ExactMath.truncate(double) methods to remove the decimal part (round toward zero) of a float or of a double respectively. These methods are intrinsified.  Added several new events to ContextsListener when language context initialization was completed or failed.  Added CompilerDirectives.isExact(Object, Class) to check whether a value is of an exact type. This method should be used instead of the value != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; value.getClass() == exactClass pattern.  Added Frame.clear(FrameSlot). This allows the compiler to reason about the liveness of local variables. Languages are recommended to use this method when applicable.  Added TruffleLanguage.Env.getLogger(String) and TruffleLanguage.Env.getLogger(Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;) creating a context-bound logger. The returned TruffleLogger always uses a logging handler and options from Env’s context and does not depend on being entered on any thread.  Added TruffleContext.leaveAndEnter(Node, Supplier) to wait for another thread without triggering multithreading.  The native image build now fails for the Truffle languages if a method that is known to be not suitable for partial evaluation is reachable for runtime compilation. The check can be disabled by the -H:-TruffleCheckBlackListedMethods option for the native-image builder.Removed the deprecated TruffleLanguage.Env.getTruffleFile(String), TruffleLanguage.Env.getTruffleFile(URI) methods.  Added TruffleContext.isCancelling() to check whether a Truffle context is being cancelled.  Added new features to the specializing DSL @NodeChild annotation: Added implicit and implicitCreate attributes to allow implicit creation of child nodes by the parent factory method.  Added allowUncached and uncached attributes to allow using @NodeChild with @GenerateUncached.  Profiles now can be disabled using Profile.disable() and reset using Profile.reset().  Added support for two-phase attach in the Truffle instrumentation with the new EventBinding.attach() method.A detailed list of all the changes can be found in the Truffle framework changelog.",

(Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Fixed issue with strspn used in the date C extension compiled as a macro on older glibc and then missing the __strspn_c1 symbol on newer glibc (see #2406).21.2.0(2021-07-20)  Java and Compiler Updates  Platform Updates  Native Image  Polyglot Runtime  Java on Truffle  JavaScript  WebAssembly  LLVM Runtime  Ruby  Python  R  Tools  Polyglot Embedding  Truffle Language and Tool ImplementationsJava and Compiler Updates  The OpenJDK release that GraalVM Community Edition is built on was updated to:          8u302 for Java 8 based GraalVM Community. See OpenJDK 8u302 Updates      11.0.12 for Java 11-based GraalVM Community. See OpenJDK 11.0.12 Updates      16.0.2 for Java 16-based GraalVM Community. See OpenJDK 16.0.2 Updates        The Oracle JDK release that GraalVM Enterprise Edition is built on was updated to:          8u301 for Java 8-based GraalVM Enterprise. See Java SE 8 release notes      11.0.12 for Java 11-based GraalVM Enterprise. See Java SE 11 release notes      16.0.2 for Java 16-based GraalVM Enterprise. See Java SE 16 release notes        Improved loop limit analysis for counted loops. The compiler will now detect and refine the range of an induction variable by taking the preceding conditions into account. When the loop is counted, it becomes amendable for advanced optimizations like partial unrolling, inversion, and vectorization. Read more here. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Added a novel SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) vectorization optimization for sequential code. This optimization is disabled by default until the 21.3 release. Enable it with -Dgraal.VectorizeSIMD=true. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Added a novel Strip Mining optimization for non-counted loops. Strip mining is disabled per default. Enable it with the -Dgraal.StripMineNonCountedLoops=true option. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  The existing StringBuilderOptimizationPhase performs high level transformations on StringBuilder patterns to directly construct the final String and eliminate unnecessary intermediate Strings and StringBuilders. This release adds support for this optimization in JDK11 by adding support for the compact String representation used in the JDK. The core optimizations were improved to handle more code shapes and to constant fold more operations. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Improved safepoint elimination in long counted loops. The compiler can now eliminate safepoints in loops that have a long induction variable (as opposed to an int) where it can statically prove that the range of the induction variable (i.e., the maximum number of iterations) is Integer.MAX_VALUE - Integer.MIN_VALUE while previously it would only consider int-typed induction variables. Read more here. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Added an optimization that tries to move writes out of loops, called “Write Sinking.” Write Sinking is an experimental feature disabled by default. Enable it with -Dgraal.OptWriteMotion=true. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Implemented a Speculative Guard Movement optimization that tries to move a loop invariant guard (e.g., an array bounds check) inside a loop to outside the loop. This change improves the geomean throughput score of GraalVM Community on SpecJVM2008 by 4.2%. The scores on the Renaissance, DaCapo, and ScalaDacapo benchmarks also increased by about 0.5%. Disable it with -Dgraal.SpeculativeGuardMovement=false.  Added intrinsic for Reference.refersTo and PhantomReference.refersTo just like it was done for C2.  Added support for applying counted loop optimizations to do/while loops whose first iteration is not guarded by the loop condition.  Added guard hoisting loop duplication phase which should contribute to ahead-of-time compilation flow (GraalVM Native Image). It splits certain loops into “fast” and “slow” versions. The fast loop is chosen if we know at run time that no exceptions can happen. The fast loop allows more loop optimizations and loop vectorization. Loop duplication needs the profile-guided optimizations data. Disable it with -H:-GuardHoistingLoopDuplication.  Improved the Graal compiler to allow compiling ahead-of-time methods with more than 64 loops. This resolves a problem that was preventing Native Image from compiling programs with more than 64 loops in a method body. This is a pattern often seen in generated Java code, such as that output by tools such as ANTLR.Platform Updates  Linux AArch64: GraalVM distributions for AArch64 CPU architecture are released as supported in 21.2 with more features enabled, like Ruby runtime, and Java on Truffle (Espresso).  Java 16 support: GraalVM builds based on Oracle JDK 16 or OpenJDK 16 remain experimental in this release, but have become more “mature” by overcoming some known limitations and adding support for Ruby, Python, and WebAssembly runtimes.Native Image  Released new official Gradle and Maven plugins for Native Image with initial JUnit 5 testing support. These plugins will make building, testing, and running Java applications as native executables much easier, and the native JUnit support allows JVM libraries to run their test suites via GraalVM Native Image. For more details, read the announcement blog post.  Added basic Java Flight Recorder (JFR) support on JDK 11. This feature was developed in a cooperation between Oracle and Red Hat. Native images that are built with -H:+AllowVMInspection support JFR events that are written in Java (see jdk.jfr.Event). To record JFR events at run time, JFR support and JFR recording must be enabled. Check the documentation or see the help message for -XX:+FlightRecorder and -XX:StartFlightRecording options. At the moment, JFR support is still significantly limited, i.e., most VM-internal events and also most advanced features such as stack traces or memory leak detection are still missing.  Improved resource handling: resources stored in the image can be accessed through a virtual file system.  Implemented the class pre-definition: to support ClassLoader.loadClass at run time, classes that need to be loaded at run time can be made available to the static analysis so that they are included in the closed-world analysis. This improves compatibility with libraries that rely on dynamic class loading, as long as the classes loaded or generated at run time are stable. This feature was developed in cooperation with Oracle and Alibaba.  Removed unnecessary security providers from the image: the reachable security providers are automatically detected by the static analysis. We fixed some bugs that made too many providers reachable in some cases, leading to large and non-deterministic image sizes. It is now also possible to disable the automatic detection completely using -H:-EnableSecurityServicesFeature.  Added an “epsilon” GC to build an image without any garbage collector, which is applicable for very short running applications that only allocate a small amount of memory.  The application fails when more than the maximum heap size is allocated. Enable it at image build time with --gc=epsilon.  Changed the --initialize-at-build-time option behaviour to be used only with arguments. This prevents users to write non-composable code and to avoid accidental semantic errors.Polyglot Runtime  Added a new compilation queuing heuristic enabled by default. The new heuristic improves the warmup time of the polyglot runtime on many workloads. It detects code being currently executed and prioritizes the compilation of such code. The new queue implementation also uses dynamic compilation thresholds that increase and decrease compilation thresholds depending on the load of the compilation queue. The new heuristic can be enabled or disabled using --engine.TraversingCompilationQueue=true|false. A more detailed description of the new heuristic can be found here.  VM inspection is now enabled in all launchers by default. It is no longer necessary to rebuild the language launcher image to enable inspection. The SIGQUIT signal can now be used to print thread dumps at any point during their execution. By additionally enabling the performance counters with the --vm.XX:+UsePerfData option in GraalVM Enterprise, VisualVM is able to attach and monitor language launchers that run with native-image.Java on Truffle  Introduced Truffle on Java HotSwap Plugin API which allows to reload the code without the need for restarting a running application. It is meant for framework developers to reflect changes to, e.g., annotations, framework-specific updates such as implemented services or beans. For more details, check the documentation.  Improved bytecode dispatch, yielding a 15-30% interpreter speed-up.  Added a new static object model implementation that dynamically generates host classes at run time. It is experimental at the moment.  Added fixes to prevent crashes when external threads enter Espresso and call native code.  Fixed crashes when running with older versions of GNU libc (&amp;lt;= 2.17).  Added support for additional interoperability messages for guest objects implementing Map, Map.Entry, List, Iterator, or Iterable.JavaScript  GraalVM JavaScript now prints a warning when runtime compilation is not supported. This warning can be disabled using the -engine.WarnInterpreterOnly=false option or the -Dpolyglot.engine.WarnInterpreterOnly=false system property.  Added the js.unhandled-rejections option to track unhandled promise rejections in a polyglot Context. By default, the option is set to none, and unhandled promise rejections are not tracked.  Implemented the New Set Methods proposal. It is available behind an experimental flag (--js.new-set-methods).  Implemented experimental operator overloading support. Use the experimental option --js.operator-overloading to enable it and consult the documentation.  Updated the RegExp Match Indices proposal with opt-in using the d flag. Available in ECMAScript 2022 (-js.ecmascript-version=2022). Deprecated the -js.regexp-match-indices option.The changelog is available in the project repository.WebAssembly  GraalVM’s WebAssembly now correctly detects memory-allocation failures, and throws WebAssembly errors as per specification (RangeError exception), instead of returning internal engine errors.  Fixed edge-cases in calls to functions from imported tables. In indirect calls (call_indirect instruction) GraalWasm will now correctly type-check the function type when the function is exported from a different module and set as an entry in an imported table.  Improved detection of some arithmetic errors, printing out a more specific type of the arithmetic exception. In the earlier version, handling of certain arithmetic errors caused a NullPointerException.  Performed general maintenance work and fixed bugs to pass tests for as many NPM modules that use WebAssembly as possible.LLVM Runtime  Added support for pthreads and pthread synchronization primitives in managed mode such aspthread_create, pthread_exit, pthread_join, pthread_mutex, pthread_rwlock, pthread_cond, and more. This enables a user to run multi-threaded programs. Previously, it would just fail when a user tried to run a multi-threaded software. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Updated musl libc to version 1.2.2. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Added support for C++ virtual calls via cross-language interoperability.  Added support for atomic versions of already existing assembly instructions. This means that the LLVM runtime now has wider support for inline assembly, especially for multi-threaded software.  Fixed GraalVM’s LLVM toolchain not working correctly for C++ on MacOS 11.3 (see #3383.The project changelog is available on GitHub.Ruby  Implemented the precise invalidation for Ruby methods and constants, by using per-name and per-class assumptions.  Updated to Ruby 2.7.3 (fixes CVE-2021-28965 and CVE-2021-28966). The resolv stdlib was not updated (resolv in 2.7.3 has bugs).  Fixed the LLVM toolchain issue on macOS 10.13 (see  #3383).  Improved the #dig method to make iteration through arrays and hashes faster and compile better for calls with 3+ arguments (see #2301).  Improved fiber-local variables by using less synchronization which made them faster.  TruffleSafepoint is now used instead of custom logic, which no longer invalidates JIT-ed code for guest safepoints (e.g., Thread#{backtrace,raise,kill}, ObjectSpace, etc.).A full list of changes is available in the changelog.Python  Implemented _pickle as a faster version than the pure Python version. Users will see better performance when serializing objects across the network. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Improved Python performance especially during warmup and in shared engine configurations by adding fast paths, intrinsifying functions, and adding optimized representations for common data structures.  Applied the new Truffle safepoint mechanism for more efficient GIL releases, signal handlers, and weak reference callbacks.  Updated the supported HPy version to 0.0.2.  Added support for the dict type properly using the new hash interoperability messages. Now Python dictionaries can be cast to java.util.Map and behave as expected when using Python from Java.  GraalVM Python runtime now passes more compatibility tests for io, crypt, and more functions in socket, OrderedDict, and time. The code written for Python 3.8 that uses these can be expected to work better now.  Added initial support for the psutil package which enables system access and processes monitoring, and for the PyGame modules designed for writing video games.  GraalVM’s Python no longer unconditionally creates _pycache_ if the file name “sitecustomize.py” exists in the current working directory.More details can be found in the changelog.R  Continued improving the compatibility with R 4.0.3. For example, the support for rlang 0.4.10, vctrs 3.6, tibble 3.0.6, and testthat 3.0.1  packages was significantly improved.  Packages with known issues, dplyr 1.0.3, ggplot 3.3.3, and knitr 1.31, still remain.More details are available in the project changelog.ToolsVisual Studio Code  Renamed extensions for VS Code as following:          GraalVM Tools for Java      GraalVM Extension Pack for Java      GraalVM Tools for Micronaut      GraalVM Tools for Java Extension  Implemented full support of JDK16 and its language features.  Added support for developing, running, and debugging single Java class, supported from JDK8 and beyond.      Introduced a wizard to easily create a new Java project:        Introduced a new class wizard “Java: New From Template” that allows to add various Java and related files to a project:        Implemented the possibility to attach a debugger to a running process. Available via Run and Debug “Java 8+…” configuration.    Improved Java code navigation with “GoTo Type”, “Find Usages” options.  Enabled the Native Image agent to gather the configuration data in the “Run without Debugger” mode. This makes it easier to build native images from VS Code. Use a special launch configuration Launch Java 8+ Application With Native Image Agent.GraalVM Tools for Micronaut Extension  Added  “Launch Java: Continuous Mode” launch configuration also known as “Run Dev Mode” for Gradle and Maven projects:  Developed and ran Spock tests in the Groovy language. Included code completion and other editing support for Groovy.VisualVM and VS Code Integration  Added a special section to the VS Code Gr activity to control the VisualVM tool included in the active GraalVM installation. Find more information in this feature documentation, but the major updates are:          Enabled to start VisualVM along with the VS Code project      Provided actions to take a thread or heap dump, and to configure and control CPU/Memory sampling and JFR recording      Enabled the Go to Source action in VisualVM views which opens the sources back in VS Code      VisualVM  Added a feature that allows to save JFR recording from live process (see #297).  Implemented a lock contentions profiling feature, by adding a Lock Contention view in the Profiler tab (see #298).  Added support for JDK 17.  Enabled controlling VisualVM instance from the command line or an external tool: start sampling (#321), control flight recording (#322), taking a thread (#319) or a heap dump (#320) of a Java process from the terminal.  Published Maven artifacts for VisualVM.Polyglot Embedding As announced in the 21.1 release notes, we have updated the required JVMCI version for Polyglot Embeddings in this release. All GraalVM JDK versions (8, 11, 16) already contain the updated JVMCI version and there is no further action required. If you are using a different JDK than GraalVM and you have configured the Graal compiler on the upgrade module path you will need one of the following JDK versions that includes JDK-8264016 for full compatibility:  Other JDK 11: Oracle JDK 11.0.13 (2021-10-19), OpenJDK is still to be determined.  Other JDK 16: No current plans to update JVMCI.  Other JDK 17: The new JVMCI version is already integrated into early access builds.If your JVMCI version is outdated, you will be able to use GraalVM embeddings, but forced context cancellation (Context.close(true)) and interrupt (Context.interrupt(Duration)) will throw an error. We recommend the following workarounds:  Do not use forced context cancellation or interrupt. All other features are still supported.  Switch to the fallback runtime by removing graal.jar from the upgrade-module-path. Note that this will significantly worsen performance and should only be a last resort.  Wait with upgrading to 21.2 until the JDK version has support for the new JVMCI version.Other changes:  Changed the behaviour of Value.as(TypeLiteral&amp;lt;Function&amp;lt;Object, Object&amp;gt;&amp;gt;).apply(): when the function is called with an Object[] argument, it is passed through as a single argument rather than an array of arguments (see #456).A full list of changes can be found here.Truffle Language and Tool Implementations  Added support for Truffle libraries to be prepared for ahead-of-time compilation without prior execution. See ExportLibrary.useForAOT or the AOT Tutorial for more details.  Implemented DebugValue methods hashCode() and equals() to provide results of the interoperability identityHashCode and isIdentical calls on the corresponding guest objects, respectively.  Added support for iterators and hash maps to DebugValue. The added methods delegate to the respective methods of InteropLibrary.  Methods annotated with @Fallback of the Truffle specialization DSL now support @Cached, @CachedContext, @CachedLanguage, @Bind and dispatched @CachedLibrary parameters.  Added TruffleContext.pause() and TruffleContext.resume(Future&amp;lt;Void&amp;gt;) to pause and resume execution for a Truffle context, respectively.  Added CompilerDirectives.blackhole(value) which can be helpful for benchmarking.  Added TruffleLanguage#Env.registerOnDispose(Closeable) registering a Closeable for automatic close on context dispose.  Added RootNode#countsTowardsStackTraceLimit(), replacing RootNode#isInternal() as the criterion that determines whether a frame with the given root node counts towards the stack trace limit.  Added MemoryFence which provides methods for fine-grained control of memory ordering (see #2031).  Deprecated ValueProfile.createEqualityProfile() without replacement. Object.equals(Object) cannot safely be used on compiled code paths. Use the Truffle Specialization DSL instead to implement caches with equality semantics. Making Object.equals(Object) reachable as runtime compiled method will mark too many equals implementations reachable for runtime compilation in a native image.  Deprecated and added methods to support expected arity ranges in ArityException instances. Note that the replacement methods now include more strict validations.  The Specialization DSL now generates code to throw an AssertionError if a @Shared and @Cached parameter returns a non-null value and is used in a guard. The null state is reserved for the uninitialized state.  Added LoopConditionProfile#create() as an alias of createCountingProfile() so it can be used like @Cached LoopConditionProfile loopProfile.A full list of changes can be found here.",

See Java SE 8 release notes      11.0.13 for Java 11-based GraalVM Enterprise. See Java SE 11 release notes      17.0.1 for Java 17-based GraalVM Enterprise. See Java SE 17 release notes      Java and Compiler Updates  Improved the Strip Mining optimization for non-counted loops (only available in GraalVM Enterprise), which includes:          Enabled Strip Mining for non-counted loops by default.      Improved counted loop detection for inequality checked loops. Now more uncounted loops are converted to counted loops, becoming subject to further optimization such as vectorization and partial unrolling. This extra optimization adds to better performance. Take this loop as an example:        for (int i = start; i != end; i++){ // body}        The compiler cannot statically prove that start &amp;lt; end and so this loop may have to overflow i before it terminates.The compiler now inserts a start &amp;lt; end check before the loop.If this check fails, the compiled code will deoptimize and the next time it is compiled,the check will be omitted and the loop will be treated as uncounted.              Added a new Infeasible Path Correlation optimization to eliminate infeasible paths (only available in GraalVM Enterprise). Have a look at this snippet:    class A { ... }class B extends A { ... }if (x &amp;gt; 5) {    if (y instanceof A) {        throw Error();    }}loop {    int foo = &amp;lt;expensive computation&amp;gt;;    if (x &amp;gt; 10) {        if (y instanceof B) {            bar(foo);        }    }}    The bar(foo) call will only be executed if x &amp;gt; 10 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; y instanceof B.However, that condition implies x &amp;gt; 5 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; y instanceof A which means throw Error() will be executed.That is, the call to bar can never actually be executed.The Graal compiler now recognizes this and eliminates both the call to bar as well as the computation of foo if it is only used as an argument to bar.This optimization is enabled by default and can be disabled with -Dgraal.InfeasiblePathCorrelation=false.    Implemented support for Constant Blinding to defend against JIT spraying attacks. In a JIT spraying attack, an attacker uses the JIT compiler to inject machine instructions in executable memory by using operations with immediate values. Given an existing memory corruption vulnerability, the attacker can then redirect control flow to the injected code. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)The constant blinding phase encrypts user supplied constants in the code with a randomly generated key, so that the attacker cannot rely on the immediate value being present in executable memory:    mov reg, $0xF5952Cxor reg, $0xABCDEF // reg = 0x5E58C3    Constant Blinding is an experimental feature disabled by default. Enable it with -Dgraal.BlindConstants=true.Configure with -Dgraal.MinimumBlindedConstantSize the size of constants (in bytes) above which constant blinding will be applied.    Improved the SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) vectorization optimization for sequential code (only available in GraalVM Enterprise):          SIMD Vectorization and Partial Loop Unrolling can now be enabled at the same time. It is no longer necessary to specify -Dgraal.PartialUnroll=false to maximize the benefit achieved from SIMD Vectorization. This optimization is now enabled by default.      SIMD Vectorization can now create groups of operations which do not completely fill a vector register. This increases the number of acceleration opportunities SIMD Vectorization is able to realize and so improves overall throughput performance.      Improved grouping and pattern matching in SIMD Vectorization to increase the number of SIMD opportunities the optimization can find and successfully exploit.            Added a new optimization that prevents inlining from negatively impacting register allocation and code size for certain caller/callee combinations. This can improve performance because fewer values may be existing concurrently in a program. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)    Added compiler intrinsics for following methods in both JVM and Native Image mode: Math.signum, Math.copySign, Reference.refersTo and PhantomReference.refersTo.The way intrinsics operate is to replace a native method with direct machine code. Thus intrinsification of the above Java methods removes the overhead of native calls, which is considerable and improves the overall performance. For example, intrinsifying Reference.refersTo and PhantomReference.refersTo fixed the performance regression reported in this GitHub issue.A full list of compiler changes in GraalVM Community Edition can be found in the compiler changelog.Native Image  Improved the Native Image configuration: configuration file entries that are necessary at image build time for Reflection, JNI, class path resources, and Dynamic Proxy objects, can now be conditional based on the reachability of a class. This allows a more precise configuration, which can reduce the size of a native image. See the documentation and find there an example for a conditional reflection configuration.  Improved gathering the reflection metadata by the native-image builder: Native Image now distinguishes between queried and invoked reflection methods. Calling Class.getDeclaredMethods (and all the other variants to look up methods and constructors) now returns all reachable methods for all classes. Previously, only methods that were explicitly registered for reflective invocation were returned. This new feature allows significant reduction of the manual reflection configuration: only methods that need to be invoked via Method.invoke, or methods that would not be seen as reachable based on reachability, need to be registered manually. This distinction between queried and invoked reflection methods reduces the filesize of a native image.      Added several new optimizations to reduce the image size as well as the image build time for large applications. This has been an ongoing effort for several releases. The following table shows the image size and image build time for Spring petclinic-jdbc, a well-known large application. The numbers are measured on a developer laptop with Linux, AMD64, JDK 11, GraalVM Enterprise, spring-native 0.10.3:                            GraalVM Version          Image Build Time          Image Size                                      GraalVM 21.1          170 sec.          138 MByte                          GraalVM 21.2          163 sec.          133 MByte                          GraalVM 21.3          133 sec.          119 MByte                      Added initial support for the Java Platform Module System: The native-image builder now accepts the module-related arguments known from the java launcher like -m, -p, and --add-opens. When such a module-related argument is used, the image generator itself is used as a module too. This is a major change in how the image generator works, and development is still ongoing to support more aspects of the module system. Please provide feedback and bug reports when you try out this new feature.  Changed the way the compiler is looked up when creating static, musl-based native images to use the musl toolchain from musl.cc. The musl toolchain greatly simplifies the creation of static native images. Using a toolchain also ensures minimum changes will be needed on users’ side to create a dynamically linked musl based image. See the documentation.  Added a new policy for the Serial GC reducing the memory footprint of applications at run time. The new policy enables survivor spaces for the young generation, a feature that has been present in the codebase for a while but was not enabled by default. In addition, a full GC no longer scans the whole image heap for root pointers, but only parts of the image heap that have been written to. The new policy is not enabled by default (this is planned for the next release) but can be enabled using -H:InitialCollectionPolicy=Adaptive. Please test the new policy and report any regressions so that they can be addressed before the next release.  Improved the precision of the static analysis: small methods are now inlined before the static analysis. This improves constant folding and reduces surprises. For example, previously code that accessed a static final field directly was optimized differently from code that accessed a static final field via an accessor method:    void foo() {   if (MyConfiguration.WINDOWS) {     // The static analysis does not see this code as reachable on non-Windows platforms.  }}static boolean isWindows() {  return MyConfiguration.WINDOWS;}void bar() {  if (isWindows()) {    // The static analysis marked this code as reachable because the method invocation prevented constant folding before the static analysis. With method inlining before static analysis enabled now, this code is no longer seen as reachable on non-Windows platforms.  }}    Arguments to the native image generator can now be passed in a separate file that is provided with the @argument option. This is a necessary workaround for platforms like Windows where the length of the command line is limited.  Root certificates can now be configured at image run time. Previously, the root certificates present at image build time were the only root certificates available at run time. See the documentation for details, and to find a list of system properties that are now read at run time to configure the root certificates.  Crash dumps, which are printed when segfault or fatal VM errors happen, now include more details to aid diagnostics. Also, the beginning of the image heap is now protected memory so that null pointer accesses produce a segfault instead of accessing random memory. Internal VM errors, where an illegal virtual method table entry is accessed, produce a better crash dump.  On Linux, the processor count reported at run time now takes limitations set via cpuset into account.  Improved Dwarf debug info generation now includes information about inlined methods (contributed by Red Hat).  JDK Flight Recorder (JFR) support is now also available for JDK 17 based GraalVM (contributed by Red Hat).Polyglot Runtime  Improved stability and performance of the experimental engine caching feature. See the documentation for more details. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)  Improved builtin CPU sampler tool usability with all polyglot languages (see --cpusampler option).          Increased precision of the sampling output by using the new guest language safepoint mechanism. The sampling output now shows inlined methods in addition to compilation units by default.      Simplified the default sampling histogram output and added the --cpusampler.ShowTiers option to show time spent in each optimization tier.              Added the SVG flamegraph output format to the CPUSampler. To enable it, use option --cpusampler.OutputFormat=flamegraph.                    Java on Truffle  Added Java 17 guest and host support.  Enabled support using interop buffer-like object as byte[] in Java on Truffle. See “buffer elements” in the Interop API javadoc.  Added support for buffer interop messages to the explicit Interop API.  The Polyglot API is not enabled by default anymore. When needed, contexts should be created with the java.Polyglot option set to true.  The HotSwap API is not auto-enabled by debugging anymore. When needed, contexts should be created with the java.HotSwapAPI option set to true.  Added optimization to avoid illegal reflective access warnings with the host Java 11 or higher.The project changelog is available on GitHub.JavaScript  Updated Node.js to version 14.17.6.  Implemented the Error Cause proposal. It is available behind the experimental option --js.error-cause.  Implemented the Import Assertions proposal. It is available behind the experimental option --js.import-assertions.  Implemented Object.hasOwn (Accessible Object.hasOwnProperty proposal). It is available in ECMAScript 2022 (--js.ecmascript-version=2022).  Implemented support for class static initialization blocks and private fields in in. Available in ECMAScript 2022 (--js.ecmascript-version=2022).  Added an experimental polyglot Context option --js.esm-eval-returns-exports (disabled by default). When enabled, eval() of an ES module will return a polyglot Value containing the exports.  Added several WebAssembly completeness and performance fixes, including the JavaScript BigInt to WebAssembly i64 integration proposal.The changelog is available in the project repository.Ruby  TRegex is now used by default, which provides large speedups for matching regular expressions.  Fully integrated support for foreign objects traits (arrays, hashes, iterables, etc.) in polyglot mode, which now behave like their Ruby counterpart.  Added support for transparent inner contexts as used in the ExecJS gem.  Updated to Ruby 2.7.4 to fix CVE-2021-31810, CVE-2021-32066 and CVE-2021-31799.A full list of changes is available in the changelog.Python  Removed PYPY_VERSION from our C extension emulation layer. This means we no longer pretend to be PyPy for C extensions and can avoid PyPy specific hacks, which enables the PyGame package to work out of the box.  Intrinsified and optimized more of the core language for better startup and reduced footprint.  Implemented a binary compatible backend for HPy 0.0.3, which allows HPy packages to run unmodified on CPython and GraalVM Python. This is part of an ongoing effort to make more packages available to users without them having to compile them for GraalPython specifically.  Added support for the multiprocessing module via in-process nested contexts. This allows execution on multiple cores within the same process using the common Python facilities for multiprocessing.  Added support for the ctypes module, enabling more native extensions to run that use the ctypes API.  Fixed multiple REPL issues reported on Github. Users can now properly paste blocks of code and use the numpad in the REPL.  Made our marshal format compatible with CPython, so objects can now be exchanged between CPython and GraalVM Python processes.  Made most socket module tests pass in native mode, allowing usage of all POSIX socket APIs where before only those supported with Java facilities could be used. This includes, for example, Unix domain sockets and the message APIs for sockets.  Added various compatibility fixes to make the psutil package work.The project changelog is available on GitHub.R  Upgraded from PCRE to PCRE2 version 10.37. Some Unicode patterns and texts are still not supported. See GNU-R changelog (section MIGRATION TO PCRE2) for more details on potentially user visible differences between PCRE and PCRE2.  Added some usability improvements and bug fixes:          Fixed implicit make rule parameters used when building R extensions.      Fixed unexpected garbage collection of CHARSXP objects in R extensions. FastR did not materialize its internal representation of character vectors to GNU-R compatible CHARSXP objects, which caused unexpected collection of CHARSXP objects returned by STRING_ELT.      The option to ignore the user’s profile at startup, --no-init-file, works as expected now.      Fixed functions approx and approxfun from the stats package to prevent them failing with error message “Incorrect number of arguments”.      The project changelog is available on GitHub.LLVM Runtime  Updated the LLVM toolchain for compiling C/C++ to version 12.0.1.  Improved modularization of the codebase around “managed mode” and “native mode” code. This reduces static build dependencies between these two modes, at the same time making the managed mode codebase more robust by removing all unmanaged memory accesses.The project changelog is available on GitHub.WebAssembly  Improved internal implementation of GraalVM WebAssembly to make JS-WebAssembly Interface API more compliant.  Added support for importing and exporting mutable globals to GraalVM WebAssembly, as defined by the Import/Export mutable globals proposal.  Moved the module-validation checks to the earlier stage, so that a module is completely validated during parsing, instead of being validated during linking and instantiation. All validation errors are now properly reported when Context#eval from the Polyglot API is invoked, and similarly when invoking WebAssembly.validate from the JS-WebAssembly Interface API.  Added notifications to JavaScript when the memory grows (i.e., when mem_grow instruction executes). This improves the compliance of the JS-WebAssembly Interface API.  Changed the Interop objects in GraalVM WebAssembly to allow object-caching in the JS-WebAssembly Interface.  Added support for BigInt-to-i64 conversion in the JS-WebAssembly Interface API.A full list of changes can be found in the changelog.ToolsVisual Studio CodeAdded a number of refractorings to the GraalVM Extension Pack for Java. These are:  Convert to static import  Extract interface or method  Extract local variable  Assign to variable  Generate hashCode and equals  Generate toString()  Change method signature  Rename  Pull member up  Move class  for cycle, while() cycle, try-catch, switch()statement refactoringsGraalVM Tools for Java Extension      Native Image debugging in VS Code, enabled with GraalVM Tools for Java extension, was significantly improved. Now you can attach the debugger to Native Image processes and step over the image “real” code:    Implemented the ability to add GraalVM installed by a host OS utility like yum. Then components must be managed from a terminal by the same utility.      Enabled utilizing VS Code Native Test Explorer API and UI extensions.        Enabled setting conditional breakpoints:    Groovy language features are now available for Java projects which contain some Groovy files or Spock tests. For example, CodeCompletion is working, Spock tests can be debugged and run. The execution of standalone Groovy scripts is not supported.GraalVM Tools for Micronaut ExtensionAdded support for Kubernetes: now you can deploy, run and debug Micronaut applications in a Kubernetes cluster directly from VS Code.      Enabled “Create Kubernetes Deployment Resource”, “Run in Kubernetes” and “Deploy in Kubernetes” quick actions for Micronaut support:        Enabled selecting what Docker image will be used when creating a Kubernetes deployment:        Enabled selecting a secret for a Docker registry:  When you invoke the “Micronaut: Deploy to Kubernetes” action, your Java project is packaged, Docker image is built and pushed to the container registry. Deployment is created in the Kubernetes Cluster and local port is forwarded to an application running in a Pod.Polyglot Embedding  Added the ability to share values between contexts. Please see Context.Builder.allowValueSharing(boolean) for further details. The update addressed this GitHub issue.  Improved the Polyglot API by adding support for scoped values in guest-to-host callbacks. Scoped values are automatically released when the callback returns. They can be configured in HostAccess.A full list of changes can be found in the changelog.Truffle Language and Tool Implementations  Added new Static Object Model APIs to represent the layout of objects that, once defined, do not change the number and the type of their properties. It is particularly well suited for, but not limited to, the implementation of the object model of static programming languages. For more information, read the Javadoc and the tutorial.  Added BytecodeOSRNode interface to support on-stack replacement (OSR) for bytecode interpreters. OSR can improve start-up performance by switching from interpreted code to compiled code in the middle of execution. It is especially effective for targets with long-running loops, which can get “stuck” running in the interpreter without OSR. Refer to the Javadoc and the OSR guide for more details.  Language and context references can now be stored in static final fields. See the javadoc for the new intended usage. All thread local lookups have an efficient implementation on HotSpot and SubstrateVM, interpreted and compiled, eliminating the need to ever cache the value in the AST.  Added FrameInstance#getCompilationTier and FrameInstancel#isCompilationRoot  Added TruffleContext.evalPublic(Node, Source) and TruffleContext.evalInternal(Node, Source) that allow the evaluation of sources in an inner context and access values of the inner context safely.  Added --engine.TraceDeoptimizeFrame to trace frame deoptimizations due to FrameInstance#getFrame(READ_WRITE|MATERIALIZE).  Added TruffleContext.evalPublic(Node, Source) and TruffleContext.evalInternal(Node, Source) that allow to evaluate sources in an inner context and access values of the inner context safely.  Added TruffleContext.Builder.initializeCreatorContext(boolean) that allows users to disable initialization of the language that created the inner context.  Added ExecuteTracingSupport interface that allows tracing the calls to execute methods of a Node.A full list of changes can be found in the changelog.",

As of this release and later, GraalVM Enterprise distributions will be based on JDK 11 and 17 only.      Removed support for JDK versions 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16.    The OpenJDK release that GraalVM Community Edition is built on was updated to:          11.0.14 for Java 11-based GraalVM Community. See OpenJDK 11.0.14 Updates      17.0.2 for Java 17-based GraalVM Community. See OpenJDK 17 Updates        The Oracle JDK release that GraalVM Enterprise Edition is built on was updated to:          11.0.14 for Java 11-based GraalVM Enterprise. See Java SE 11 release notes      17.0.2 for Java 17 based GraalVM Enterprise. See Java SE 17 release notes      Java and Compiler Updates  Added a new loop rotation optimization that converts more non-counted loops to counted loops (only available in GraalVM Enterprise). A counted loop is an abstraction the compiler uses to ensure a loop’s iteration limit is a bound integer. When the loop is counted, it becomes amenable for partial unrolling, vectorization, and other optimizations to improve performance. For example, the following code for LinkedList.toArray() in JDK 17:    public Object[] toArray() {  Object[] result = new Object[size];  int i = 0;  for (Node&amp;lt;E&amp;gt; x = first; x != null; x = x.next)    result[i++] = x.item;  return result;}    will be optimized by the compiler to:    public Object[] toArray() {  Object[] result = new Object[size];  int i = 0;  Node&amp;lt;E&amp;gt; x = first;  if (x == null) return result;             // Loop condition 1  while (true) {    if (i |&amp;gt;=| result.length) deoptimize(); // Loop condition 2    result[i++] = x.item;    x = x.next;    if (x == null) break;                   // Loop condition 1  }  return result;}    For a microbenchmark centered on LinkedList.toArray(), loop rotation brings a gain in performance of just over 10%.For workloads containing a lot of non-counted loops with a similar shape, performance improvements of up to 30% have been measured.Loop rotation is disabled by default in 22.0 and can be enabled with -Dgraal.LoopRotation=true.    Improved the Graal compiler treatment of execution profiles. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)Graal was designed as an aggressive JIT compiler that heavily relies on profiles (see here and here) collected by the underlying runtime (HotSpot VM or Native Image).The profiles are used by the compiler to determine which branches are important, how often loops are executed, and which types are used in polymorphic code.That is, the compiler relies on profiles to determine where to focus optimization effort.As such, the quality of the profiles is critical to optimizations such as inlining, duplication, and vectorization.The compiler now automatically switches to an “AOT” (ahead-of-time) mode where major optimizations can still do a reasonable job in the absence of profiles.This helps in the following situations:          Truffle languages that do not profile uncommon patterns that still can become hot.      Native Image without PGO.        We observe performance improvements for GraalVM Enterprise of up to 25% for loop and type-check heavy benchmarks that lacked good profiles.This optimization is always enabled and cannot be disabled as it is at the core of the compiler.It is transparent to the user and should provide general better code in absence of precise branch and loop profiles.        Added a new optimization to improve the performance in Native Image of a type switch (i.e., a series of cascading instanceof branches). For example:      void foo(Object o) {    if (o instanceof A) {      // ...    } else if (o instanceof B) {      // ...    } else if (o instanceof C) {      // ...    }  }    With the new optimization, the null check and load of o’s class are factored out:      void foo(Object o) {    if (o != null) {      Object nonNullO = o;      Class oClass = nonNullO.getClass();      if (A.class.isAssignableFrom(oClass)) {        // ...      } else if (B.class.isAssignableFrom(oClass) {        // ...      } else if (C.class.isAssignableFrom(oClass)) {        // ...      }    }  }    This optimization only pays off if there are subclasses of A, B, and C that Native Image sees as allocated. Otherwise, the instanceof tests are reduced to == comparisons on the class of o.  A full list of compiler changes in GraalVM Community Edition can be found in the compiler changelog.Native Image  Added updates to reduce image size: a more compressed encoding for stack frame metadata reduces image size for all images. In addition, an optimized implementation of String.format() makes localization classes unreachable for small images such as “Hello World” and reduces their size significantly. Note: The String.format optimization is available with GraalVM Enterprise only.  GraalVM 22.0 will be the final release in which the native-image builder can be executed with JDK 8. There is no need to explicitly check for and allow JDK versions 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 because they are no longer supported. It is recommended to use Native Image with GraalVM JDK 11 or JDK 17.  Introduced a new user-friendly build output for native-image with progress bars and more summary information about a native image build process. The previous output can be restored with -H:-BuildOutputUseNewStyle.  Enabled a new garbage collection policy for the Serial Garbage Collector (Serial GC) by default. This reduces the time spent in GC and/or the RSS size of the application up to 30%. The Serial GC algorithm is a good choice for small heaps.  Improved support for the Java Platform Module System: the options --add-reads and --add-modules are now supported by native-image. Also, all module-related options such as --add-reads, --add-exports, and --add-opens are now applied before scanning the classpath/module-path. This ensures the modules are properly configured before class loading to prevent class loading errors. More information about modules is added to the image heap, which allows more module introspection at run time.  Added support for reflective introspection of sealed classes on JDK 17: Class.isSealed() and Class.getPermittedSubclasses().  Removed support for JLine 2. Substitutions for JLine 2 were historically included in Native Image. Since JLine 2 is no longer maintained, the support was removed without replacement.  Removed the option -H:SubstitutionFiles=... to register substitutions via a JSON file.  Updated the C to Java interoperability: custom prolog, epilogue, and exception handling methods for @CEntryPoint entry points from C to Java must be annotated with @Uninterruptible. They were always treated as uninterruptible, but now they must be marked explicitly.  Improved the Native Image API: added CEntryPoint#include attribute which can be used to control if the entry point should be automatically added to a shared library. The Native Image API is now also supported on the Windows AARCH64 platform.JavaScript  Enabled ECMAScript 2022 mode/features by default.  Updated Node.js to version 14.18.1.  Implemented several proposals: Intl.DisplayNames v2, Intl Locale Info, Intl.DateTimeFormat.prototype.formatRange, Extend TimeZoneName Option, Intl Enumeration API.  Added a new option js.esm-bare-specifier-relative-lookup, defaulting to false, to customize how bare specifiers for ES Modules are resolved. When disabled, bare specifiers are resolved with an absolute path lookup. When enabled, bare specifiers are resolved relative to the importing module’s path.A full list of changes is available in the changelog.Ruby  Updated to Ruby 3.0.2, see #2453. Most of Ruby 3 changes are implemented in this release, with the exception of Ractor, parser changes, and keyword arguments changes.  TruffleRuby now requires Java 11 or later and no longer supports Java 8.  Updated Regexp objects to be interned in a similar way to symbols. As a consequence, all Regexp instances are frozen.  Added various optimizations to make the interpreter faster (before the code is JIT-compiled).A full list of changes is available in the changelog.Python  Added support for pyexpat module, which is a Python module for fast non-validating XML parsing, also known as expat.  Implemented the _csv accelerator module to read and write tabular data in CSV format.  Improved compatibility with PyPI packages such as wheel, click, and ujson.The project changelog is available on GitHub.R  Improved the internal infrastructure, compatibility with the Truffle framework, and popular R packages.  Adopted the new NodeLibrary, as a replacement for the old API that was removed in this release. It provides access to guest language information associated with a particular Node location. This helps GraalVM tool developers to better support the R language.The project changelog is available on GitHub.LLVM Runtime  Switched to the new Truffle Frame API.  Optimized the loop count to report profiles also in first-tier compiled code. This improves the warmup by transitioning from first-tier to second-tier compilation sooner for loop-heavy methods.  Added a fix to properly reuse library dependencies if some library with the same “soname” is already loaded. This allows users to depend on libraries that can not be found automatically on the library search path by manually loading them first.The project changelog is available on GitHub.WebAssembly  Improved the compatibility of GraalVM’s WebAssembly runtime with the Truffle framework by adopting the new Frame API.  Implemented the Sign-Extension-Ops proposal. It is available by using the experimental option --wasm.SignExtensionOps.Java on Truffle  Improved compatibility with the Truffle framework by adopting the new Frame API.  Added support for more class changes during a class redefinition, namely changes to fields and class access modifiers. Enable with the --java.ArbitraryChangesSupport=true flag.Polyglot Embedding  Introduced the first version of Polyglot Isolates. You can spawn a native image isolate for each Engine or Context by calling Context.Builder.option(&quot;engine.SpawnIsolate&quot;, &quot;true&quot;). This enables heap isolation between the host and guest applications. Using isolates improves security, startup and warmup time of Truffle languages, and provides strong memory isolation for guest applications. In this mode, calls between host and guest are more costly as they need to cross a native boundary. It is recommended to use the HostAccess.SCOPED policy with this mode to avoid strong cyclic references between host and guest. This mode is experimental in this release and only supported for JavaScript. (Only available in GraalVM Enterprise.)The project changelog is available on GitHub.Truffle Language and Tool Implementations  Added new APIs to com.oracle.truffle.api.frame.Frame and com.oracle.truffle.api.frame.FrameDescriptor:          Added a new “namespace” of index-based slots in Frame that is defined during construction of the frame descriptor and cannot be changed afterward.      Added a second new “namespace” of slots (called auxiliary slots) in Frame that can be added to the frame descriptor dynamically (and which only supports “object” slots).      In addition to get.../set... methods, the new API also supports copy and swap of frame slots.      FrameSlotTypeException is now an unchecked exception, which simplifies many APIs and removes the need for the FrameUtil class.        Introduced sharing layers. A sharing layer is a set of language instances that share code within one or more polyglot contexts. In previous releases language instances were shared individually whenever a new language context was created. Instead, language instances are now reused for a new context if and only if the entire layer can be shared. A layer can be shared if all of its initialized languages support the same context policy and their options are compatible. Note some changes in observable language behavior:          For any executed Truffle node it can now be assumed that the current language instance will remain constant.      TruffleLanguage.initializeMultipleContexts() is now guaranteed to be called before all created contexts of the same language instance.      Language initialization will now fail if a new language context is initialized and the language is incompatible to the sharing layer of the current context.      A complete list of behavioral changes can be found in the changelog. Read more on code sharing in the javadoc.        Introduced a Truffle Exit API to support exit across multiple languages. It provides a unified way for languages to trigger the exit. When triggered, all initialized guest languages are first notified using TruffleLanguage.exitContext(C,ExitMode,int), then all context threads are stopped, and finally, the context is closed. See the documentation for more details.  Imposed a new requirement in TruffleLanguage.finalizeContext(Object) for leaving all remaining unclosed inner contexts created by the language on all threads where the contexts are still active. No active inner context is allowed after TruffleLanguage.finalizeContext(Object) returns. Not complying with this requirement will result in an internal error. Note that inactive inner contexts are still closed implicitly by the parent context.  Improved the output format for engine.TraceCompilation and engine.TraceCompilationDetails. See the documentation for details.  Added the --engine.TraceCodeSharing option that allows logging debug information on code sharing.  Added the --engine.ForceCodeSharing and --engine.DisableCodeSharing options to force enable and force disable code sharing. These options are useful for testing to enable or disable sharing across all contexts of a process.A full list of updates can be found in the changelog.ToolsVS Code Extensions      Added the Project Explorer which provides an overview of logical project structure, groups sources together and greatly simplifies Java package structure exploration. Project Explorer is an addition to the classical workspace explorer. Use it to build, test, execute and operate your Maven and Gradle Java projects:            Introduced a number of refactorings and improvements to GraalVM extensions for VS Code, which include:                  Provided a graphical UI for the change method signature refactoring:                            Ability to organize Imports for the source file accompanied with several other settings:                            Ability to generate equals() and hashCode() methods              Added the Outline View that provides all details about the opened Java file      Added the ability to run separate NetBeans Language Server for each VS Code instance using its own classpath and JDK. Use a new option userdir = global | local:        Added the ability to manage GraalVM installation(s) with SDKMan  Improved the Groovy language support by performance and reliability improvements, and ability to run a standalone Groovy script file (without Spock tests)  Updated the Micronaut Gradle plugin to use the official GraalVM Native Image build plugin. As a consequence, the Micronaut: Build Native Image… action calles the nativeCompile job instead of nativeImage.VisualVM      Added exact thread state monitoring using JFR events. See #363.            Added preliminary support for JDK 18.  ",

          "content": "22.1.0(2022-04-26)  Platform Updates  Java and Compiler Updates  Native Image  JavaScript  Ruby  Python  R  LLVM Runtime  Java on Truffle  Polyglot Embedding  Truffle Language and Tool Implementations  ToolsPlatform Updates      Added support for Apple Silicon, an ARM-based system on a chip by Apple Inc. You can download the GraalVM Community distribution for this platform from GitHub. Look for darwin-aarch64. Currently, you can use the JVM with libgraal, Native Image, the JavaScript runtime, and Java on Truffle features with this distribution. The support is experimental.        Updated the OpenJDK release on which GraalVM Community Edition is built to:          11.0.15 for Java 11-based GraalVM Community. See OpenJDK 11.0.15 Updates      17.0.3 for Java 17-based GraalVM Community. See OpenJDK 17 Updates      Java and Compiler Updates  A counted loop is an abstraction the compiler uses to ensure a loop’s iteration limit is a bound integer.Such loops are subject to major optimizations such as vectorization and partial unrolling.The Truffle API provides the ability to profile and speculate on a loop counter value having a max value that can be treated as constant by the compiler. The Graal compiler now respects this speculation and will unroll such loops if the max value is small enough. For example, this Ruby loop will now be unrolled:      [1, 2].each { |e| print e }    Implemented all the intrinsics annotated by @IntrinsicCandidate as of JDK 17.  Removed the DuplicateIrreducibleLoops option. To disable irreducible loop handling, set -Dgraal.MaxDuplicationFactor to a value less than or equal to 1. For ahead-of-time (AOT) compilations, the effort spent to handle irreducible loops is boosted to let Native Image support more programs with irreducible loops. In particular, this mitigates this issue.Native Image  The option --allow-incomplete-classpath is now enabled by default and deprecated as it is no longer needed. This means that, by default, linking errors are now thrown at executable run time instead of at build time. The new option --link-at-build-time enables linking at build time for a specified list of packages and classes. You can provide as many --link-at-build-time options with specific arguments on command line as you want, for example, native-image --link-at-build-time=foo.bar,foobar.core.MyClass --link-at-build-time=my.other.RandomClass ....  See #4305.  Added a new “quick build” mode to reduce the time taken to generate a native executable during development. Enable it using the existing option to select the optimization level: -Ob, where b means optimize for build time. Note that this mode can have a negative impact on peak performance and the size of the resulting executable, thus recommended for development purposes only.  Added a new experimental mode to generate conditional configuration using the Tracing agent. The agent can now generate conditional reflection configuration using a heuristic that operates on the call graph, that is, those reflection elements that are only registered when a predicate class is reachable. Two modes are supported:          By passing experimental-conditional-config-filter-file=&amp;lt;path&amp;gt; to the agent. In this mode, the agent directly generates the configuration. The filter tells the agent which code belongs to the user’s application. Conditions are only generated on the classes belonging to the user’s application.      By passing experimental-conditional-config-part to the agent and using native-image-configure generate-conditional --user-code-filter=&amp;lt;path&amp;gt; --input-dir=&amp;lt;agent-ouput&amp;gt; --output-dir=&amp;lt;config-output&amp;gt; to generate the configuration. Check the Native Image documentation for more information.            Introduced code size improvements that help reduce the size of native executables. Performance improvements and memory footprint reductions for the native-image generator lead to faster build times (independent of the new “quick build” mode). The following table shows the image size and time taken to build an executable for Spring petclinic-jdbc, a well-known large application. The numbers are measured on a developer machine with Linux, AMD64, JDK 11, GraalVM Enterprise, spring-native 0.10.3.

One of the missing features was, for example, support for Truffle just-in-time compilation.  Improved the ahead-of-time compilation of Record classes. For example, annotations of Record classes can now be accessed at executable runtime.  Added support for the following JFR events: SafepointBegin, SafepointEnd, GarbageCollection, GCPhasePause, and GCPhasePauseLevel (all contributed by Red Hat). All GC-related JFR events are currently limited to the Serial GC.  JFR can now be used to profile the native-image tool itself, for example, by adding -J-XX:StartFlightRecording=dumponexit=true on the command line to native-image.  Improved handling of static synchronized methods: the lock is no longer stored in the secondary monitor map, but instead in the mutable DynamicHubCompanion object. With this change, the synchronization of static methods is as fast as the synchronization of instance methods.  Added support for AccessControlContext that helps to control the context that can be modified using privileged operations.  References handling is now performed in a separate thread by default. It helps prevent occasional deadlocks when handling references and running garbage collection in the same thread.  Added the possibility to include helper methods in the native executable that can be invoked from gdb and therefore help debugging native executables. Provide the option -H:+IncludeDebugHelperMethods to native-image to enable this feature.  Deprecated the JDK8OrEarlier and JDK11OrLater classes because JDK 8 is no longer supported. They will be removed in a future release.  Every annotated element (classes, methods, fields, etc.) will be included in the image regardless of reachability. It may require some configuration changes, especially for dynamically-generated proxies. For example, using the following code:      @AccessedAnnotation  @NonAccessedAnnotation  class Example {  boolean func(Object obj) {      Proxy.getProxyClass(classLoader, Example.class.getDeclaredAnnotations());      obj.isAnnotationPresent(AccessedAnnotation.class);      }  }    Previously, you would only specify the [AccessedAnnotation] configuration. Now the proxy configuration would look like [AccessedAnnotation], [NonAccessedAnnotation].    Prevented class path entries in META-INF/MANIFEST.MF being processed in the wrong order. See #4374  Now using -H:CompilerBackend=llvm also works if the native-image builder runs on the module-path (when building with the --module-path flag). See #4336.  Improved building native executables inside a container if a resource path contains a forward slash, /, as a working directory. See #4002.JavaScript  Updated Node.js to version 16.14.2.  Implemented a number of proposals:          The Intl.NumberFormat v3 proposal.      The Array Grouping proposal. It is available in the ECMAScript staging mode using the --js.ecmascript-version=staging option.      The Temporal proposal. It is available behind the experimental option --js.temporal.      The Array Find from Last proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode using the --js.ecmascript-version=staging option.        Added a new option --js.string-lazy-substrings, defaulting to true, to toggle the copying behavior of String slices. When enabled, String slices internally create String views instead of copying the given String region, which increases performance but may also increase memory utilization.A full list of changes is in the changelog.Ruby  Implemented full Ruby 3 keyword arguments semantics (see #2453).  Foreign exceptions are now fully integrated, have most methods of Exception, and can be rescued with rescue Polyglot::ForeignException or rescue foreign_meta_object (see #2544).  Foreign exceptions are no longer translated to RuntimeError but instead remain as foreign exceptions, see the documentation for how to rescue them.  Added various fixes for the digest default gem, RubyGems, and Bundler (#2577, #2605, #2586).  Fixed Module#const_get to raise a NameError when nested modules do not exist, needed for Rails 7 scaffolding.  Removed extra array allocations for method calls in the interpreter to improve warmup performance.  Reduced memory footprint for C extensions (separate Init_ allocations from the rest, fewer handles, and others).  Optimized Dir[], String#&amp;lt;=&amp;gt;, Regexp#match? and File.read (see #2536).A full list of changes is available in the changelog.Python  Added support for module freezing which makes the Python REPL start 30% faster and with 40% less memory usage.  Added support for more private key formats (PKCS#1, password protected) in the ssl module.  Improved compatibility with the following PyPI packages: lxml, pytz, Pillow, urllib3, setuptools, pytest, twine, jinja2, and six.A full list of changes is in the changelog on GitHub.R  JavaGD is now the default graphical subsystem. The --R.UseInternalGridGraphics option is deprecated. Most functions from graphics grid, and grDevices base packages are supported. Supported devices are SVG, PNG, JPEG, BMP, AWT. Display lists are fully implemented. See the documentation for more information.  GraalVM’s R runtime now uses system zlib instead of its own copy of this library. This makes zlib a requirement for GraalVM’s R runtime, however, most Linux distributions and all supported macOS versions have zlib preinstalled. One conceivable situation, where this may not be the case, could be some optimized stripped-down Docker images.The project changelog is available on GitHub.LLVM Runtime  Added support for C/C++ thread-local storage.  Added support for new interop APIs:          Date, Time, TimeZone and Instant (see graalvm/llvm/polyglot-time.h)      Buffers (see graalvm/llvm/polyglot-buffer.h)        Replaced custom logging options in the --llvm.* namespace (e.g., --llvm.traceIR) with Truffle Logger options (--log.llvm.*, for example, --log.llvm.TraceIR.level=FINER).See a full list of changes and option replacements in the project changelog on GitHub.Java on Truffle  Enabled explicit reference processing in single-threaded mode. This means the single-threaded mode is usable in many more situations to prevent leaking resources. It is available as a command called &amp;lt;ProcessReferences&amp;gt;, which can be run with context.eval(&quot;java&quot;, &quot;&amp;lt;ProcessReferences&amp;gt;&quot;).  Introduced new hotswap capabilities:          Added support for changing the super class and implemented interfaces.      Added support for ‘Move Field in Hierarchy’ refactoring where the state is preserved.      Turned on by default changing fields and class access modifiers.        Enabled responding to Truffle safepoints more promptly in many situations (including when using monitors).  Adopted the AbstractTruffleException API to improve exception handling thrown during the execution of a guest language program.  Added a new implementation for reading jimages (libs/modules), which is enabled by default. This improves context startup time when using the LLVM backend. Use --java.JImage=native to revert to the old implementation.  The Java on Truffle LLVM Java libraries are now provided for macOS (previously they were available for Linux distributions only) and can be installed using GraalVM Updater: gu install espresso-llvm.Polyglot Embedding  Changed the default Object target type mapping (Value.as(Object.class)) for values that have both array elements and members from Map to List. Note that this is an incompatible change. Embedders relying on the dynamic type Map after an Object target type coercion will have to migrate their code. The previous behavior can be restored using a custom target type mapping, for example:      HostAccess access = HostAccess.newBuilder(HostAccess.EXPLICIT)          .targetTypeMapping(Value.class, Object.class, v -&amp;gt; v.hasMembers() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; v.hasArrayElements(), v -&amp;gt; v.as(Map.class))          .build();  try (Context c = Context.newBuilder().hostAccess(access).build()) {      // run application  }  The changelog is available on GitHub.Truffle Language and Tool Implementations  Added an API for Truffle languages, namely Language#getWebsite(), and Instrument#getWebsite() for instruments to provide information for a website. Developers can specify a URL for a website with further information about their language/tool.  Added the TruffleStrings implementation, a primitive String type that can be shared between Truffle languages (languages implemented with the Truffle framework). Check Truffle Strings guide for more information.  Added a @GeneratePackagePrivate annotation to change the visibility of generated nodes to package-private even if the template node is public.  Added TruffleLanguage.Env#createHostAdapter accepting host symbols and host classes as the types to extend, replacing and deprecating the java.lang.Class-based version.  Added the usageSyntax property to Option enabling developers to specify the syntax that their option expects. See the Javadoc for more information.  Removed the deprecated TruffleException (deprecated since GraalVM 20.3.0). The AbstractTruffleException no longer implements TruffleException. The AbstractTruffleException methods inherited from the TruffleException have been removed. As part of this removal, the recommendation for languages on how to handle exceptions has been updated.  Added methods to TruffleContext.Builder that allow throwing custom guest exceptions when the newly built context is canceled, hard-exited, or closed, and the corresponding exception is about to reach the outer context. In case the customization is not used and the new context is canceled, hard-exited, or closed, Truffle newly throws an internal error.  Deprecated TruffleRuntime.getCurrentFrame() and TruffleRuntime.getCallerFrame(). They were encouraging unsafe use of the FrameInstance  class.Other deprecations and updates in the release are listed in the project changelog.ToolsGraalVM for Java VS Code Extension      Updated the workflow to download and install GraalVM Enterprise Edition and its accompanying components using the GraalVM built-in installation wizard in VS Code. As before, to install a GraalVM Enterprise core or additional components, a user has to provide a valid email address and accept the license agreement. The installation wizard will now use a download token that is bound to the user’s email address and defines the set of accepted licenses. Email verification and license acceptance take place via the user’s email client. For more information, see the documentation.        Added the NATIVE IMAGE pane to automate the process of tracking and registering dynamic feature calls, making it even easier to build a native executable in VS Code. The pane becomes available when you install GraalVM and with Native Image:            Improved the VS Code integration in VisualVM with the extension. Now you do not have to create a special launch configuration to open VisualVM and start monitoring a Java process. Click the play button in the VISUALVM pane:            Improved Groovy support including the ability to Run and Debug Groovy.  GraalVM Updater  Enhanced the workflow to install components to GraalVM Enterprise Edition from the command line using GraalVM Updater, gu. GraalVM Updater will create and use a download token, which is bound to the user’s email address and defines the set of accepted licenses. As before, to install a component, the user has to provide a valid email address and accept the license agreement, but now the email verification and the license acceptance will happen in the user’s email client.

          "content": "22.2.0(2022-07-26)  Platform Updates  Java and Compiler Updates  Native Image  Polyglot Runtime  JavaScript  Ruby  Python  R  LLVM Runtime  Java on Truffle  WebAssembly  Polyglot Embedding  Truffle Language and Tool Implementations  ToolsPlatform Updates  Improved GraalVM packaging experience by reducing the size of the base binary almost ~2x. JavaScript, LLVM runtimes, and VisualVM are now decoupled from the main package and released as separate installable components. The package size of, for example, the GraalVM Community Linux distribution dropped from ~430 MB to ~250 MB. This makes GraalVM more modular offering the same RPM-like experience when you add support for only what you need.  The Native Image component size has increased because necessary runtime components (Substrate VM) and static libraries (used by Substrate VM) are now part of the Native Image installable.  Improved Apple Silicon support:          Released GraalVM Enterprise distribution for Apple Silicon (AArch64 architecture). The support is experimental.      Extended the supported GraalVM functionalities in the existing GraalVM Community distribution for Apple Silicon. You can now optionally install Native Image, the LLVM toolchain, Java on Truffle, and language runtimes for JavaScript, Ruby, WebAssembly.            GraalVM will no longer run on some older Linux AMD64 distributions. It is now built against glibc 2.17 (instead of 2.12), and as a result it may not run on Oracle Linux 6 or other RHEL 6 derivatives.    Updated the OpenJDK release on which GraalVM Community Edition is built to:          11.0.16 for Java 11-based GraalVM Community. See OpenJDK 11.0.16 Updates      17.0.4 for Java 17-based GraalVM Community. See OpenJDK 17 Updates        Updated the Oracle JDK release on which GraalVM Enterprise Edition is built to:          11.0.16 for Java 11-based GraalVM Enterprise. See Java SE 11 release notes      17.0.4 for Java 17-based GraalVM Enterprise. See Java SE 17 release notes      Java and Compiler Updates      Improved the RSS memory usage by the JIT compiler (Graal) in GraalVM Community Edition. The memory used by libgraal is now reclaimed when compilation goes idle. It reduces RSS usage of JIT in a stable state (few or no compilations happening). To measure RSS memory usage of a Java process, you can run ps aux --sort -rss. See JDK-8242440.        Enhanced the Novel Strip Mining optimization for counted loops. The optimization can be enabled with this option: -Dgraal.StripMineCountedLoops=true. Strip Mining optimization converts a single long running loop into a nested loop where the inner body runs for a bounded time. It allows you to put a safepoint in the outer loop to reduce the overhead of safepoint polling. By choosing the right value for the outer loop stride, you still ensure reasonable time-to-safepoint latency. The latter is particularly important for low pause time collectors such as ZGC and Shenandoah. For example, this loop:      int checksum = 0;          for (int i = Integer.MIN_VALUE; i &amp;lt; Integer.MAX_VALUE; i++) {              checksum += i;              // safepoint_poll          }    would become:      int checksum = 0;  for (int i = Integer.MIN_VALUE; i &amp;lt; Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1000; i += 1000) {      for (int j = i; j &amp;lt; i + 1000; j++) {          checksum += j;      }      // safepoint_poll  }  for (int i = Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1000; i &amp;lt; Integer.MAX_VALUE; i++) {      checksum += i;      // safepoint_poll  }    This optimization adds to Truffle guest language safepoints latency. For example, Novel Strip Mining optimization eliminates HotSpot safepoints from a counted loop that does allocation (the HotSpot allocation slow path has a safepoint). However, this allocation related safepoint will not trigger a Truffle safepoint. As such, the Truffle safepoint latency can be very long. In this case, Novel Strip Mining optimization can decompose such a loop into strips and issue a Truffle safepoint poll once per strip.        Enabled floating and global value numbering of division nodes early on in the compilation pipeline if it is known they will not trap. This means division-by-constant operations can be commoned and moved out of loops if the constant divisor proves that they cannot throw div-by-zero exceptions. See #3866.        Introduced a global value numbering optimization for fixed nodes early in the compilation pipeline. Disabled by default, but can be enabled with  -Dgraal.EarlyGVN=true. This optimization improve workloads that require complex partial escape analysis and unrolling optimizations in order to optimize away constant loops with complex object allocations. This optimization can also speed up Native Image build time (by reducing graph sizes earlier in the compilation pipeline) as well as speeding up the generated native executables themselves by folding more memory operations.  Native Image  Enhanced the compatibility of GraalVM Native Image with the 3rd party libraries. The Oracle GraalVM team in conjunction with the Spring, Micronaut, and Quarkus teams have created a GitHub repository, GraalVM Reachability Metadata Repository, a centralized place that provides configuration (reachability metadata) for libraries which do not support GraalVM Native Image by default. The support needs to be enabled explicitly. For example, in Gradle you can enable this repository with:      graalvmNative {      metadataRepository {          enabled = true      }  }    The GraalVM Reachability Metadata Repository enables users to share and reuse reachability metadata for the most popular libraries in the Java ecosystem. Check the documentation for more information.        The native-image generator now runs on the module path by default. This is part of a longer-term effort to support module-based applications using a clean module-based generator. The module system prevents direct access to internals of the native-image generator by default. Applications and frameworks can still provide command-line arguments to open up the internals again using the usual module system command line options. For now, the old mode of running the native-image generator can be enabled by setting the environment variable USE_NATIVE_IMAGE_JAVA_PLATFORM_MODULE_SYSTEM=false (but note that this mode will be deleted without replacement in a future release).        Improved many internal data structures of the native-image generator to reduce the memory footprint. This makes Native Image builds more robust when running on memory-constraint environments like cloud-based build services, GitHub Actions, or in Docker containers. Many larger application now build successfully with 2 GByte of Java heap size available for the native-image generator.        Added support for Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). The native-image generator can optionally include a SBOM into a native executable to aid vulnerability scanners. Currently, the CycloneDX format is supported. Users may embed a CycloneDX SBOM into a native executable by using the -H:IncludeSBOM=cyclonedx option during compilation. After embedding the compressed SBOM into the executable, you can use the Native Image Inspect tool to extract the compressed SBOM with this command: $JAVA_HOME/bin/native-image-inspect --sbom &amp;lt;path_to_binary&amp;gt;. Check the documentation for more details. GraalVM Enterprise only        Added a new optimization for String concatenation operations (including StringBuilder operations): it eliminates temporary memory buffers during concatenation. GraalVM Enterprise only        Heap dumps at image run time are now supported in GraalVM Community Edition. Also, a new runtime option, -XX:+DumpHeapAndExit, has been introduced to dump the initial image heap of a native executable. Check the documentation how to dump the initial heap of a native executable.        Improved debugging support on Linux: The Dwarf information now contains information about parameters and local variables (contributed by Red Hat).        Certain Native Image options can now only be provided on the command-line and no longer in native-image.properties files. These options also get processed before other options so that they properly pre-configure all other options coming from both the command line and native-image.properties files. The affected options are --exclude-config, --configurations-path, --debug-attach, --diagnostics-mode, as well as all the options to print help messages.        Added a new runtime option -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError that  aborts the execution of a native executable on the first out-of-memory error.        Added support for most methods of OperatingSystemMXBean at image run time.    Annotation classes are no longer force-initialized at image build time. Like any other class, annotation classes can now be initialized either at build time or at run time using the according command-line options (--initialize-at-build-time or --initialize-at-run-time) or the Feature API. This fixes problems with transitive dependencies of annotations, including non-annotation classes that are used by annotations. See Class Initialization in Native Image.Polyglot Runtime  Introduced updates that improve interpreter-only performance for 20-30% and warmup for GraalVM supported languages.  Added support in libgraal for caching encoded graphs across Truffle compilations to speedup partial evaluation. The cache is enabled by default and can be enabled/disabled with the --engine.EncodedGraphCache option. This update contribute to faster compilation time improvements on HotSpot.  Implemented a new domain specific inlining phase for the Truffle interpreter host compilation, which improves the interpreter performance for GraalVM Native Image. See the Host Compilation for Interpreter Java code reference manual for details.A full list of updates can be found in the changelog.JavaScript  JavaScript support is now decoupled from the base GraalVM installation and can be easily added with this command: gu install js.  Improved JavaScript interoperability with Java: now foreign objects get a JavaScript prototype assigned by default, unless explicitly turned off. This feature was available behind the experimental option js.foreign-object-prototype before and now made default. Previously, if you use any foreign object like a Java array in JavaScript code, you could access it by using the index operator []. The array did however lack the Array.prototype, and thus methods like indexOf or sort could not be easily called on it. With this change, foreign objects get a fitting JavaScript prototype assigned and can be “manipulated” with regular JavaScript functions. This adds more flexibility for regular Java or GraalVM Polyglot API users.  Extended the implementation of the Temporal specification in GraalVM JavaScript, which provides standard objects and functions for working with dates and times. Changes from the specification are adopted continuously. Temporal objects can now be converted to compatible Java objects when appropriate, using the Value API’s methods like asDate(). The opposite direction, providing Java Temporal objects and using them with JavaScript Temporal methods is planned for a future release.See the project changelog.Ruby  Added support for AArch64 distribution for macOS (Apple Silicon).  Added support for OpenSSL 3.0.0 by updating the openssl gem.  Updated to Ruby 3.0.3. The 3 CVEs did not affect TruffleRuby, this is to bring the stdlib and gem update.  Implemented several changes that improve Ruby performance on GraalVM:          Reimplemented Float#to_s for better performance.      Updated reference processing by making C object free functions and other finalizers more lightweight.      Improved performance of RSTRING_PTR for interned strings.      Enabled caching constant argument formats used with rb_scan_args_kw.        Improved compatibility with CRuby 3.2: -Werror=implicit-function-declaration is now used for compiling C extensions to fail more clearly and earlier if a function is missing.A full list of changes is available in the changelog.Python  Updated to HPy version 0.0.4, which adds support for the finished HPy port of Kiwi, and the in-progress ports of Matplotlib and NumPy.  Added an experimental bytecode interpreter for faster startup and better interpreter performance. Using either the previous AST interpreter or the new bytecode interpreter can be switched using the --python.EnableBytecodeInterpreter option.The project changelog is available on GitHub.R  Implemented SET_GROWABLE_BIT and IS_GROWABLE C API functions. This fixes installation of the cpp11 0.2.6 package.  Added akima package to the list of “native packages”, so it is by default loaded by the native backend.The project changelog is available on GitHub.LLVM Runtime  The LLVM runtime is now decoupled from the base GraalVM installation and can be easily added with this command: gu install llvm.  Updated LLVM toolchain to version 14.0.3.  Added support for AArch64 distribution for macOS (Apple Silicon).  Improved support for POSIX Threads, pthreads, managed execution mode. In mode does not allow to call native code and access native memory.Java on Truffle  Added support for AArch64 distribution for macOS (Apple Silicon).  Improved class redefinition: added support appending enum constants. This makes HotSwap capabilites more powerful while changing classes at runtime during a debugging session. See the Enhanced HotSwap Capabilities with Java on Truffle guide.  Enable the new Class Hierarchy Analysis by default. It provides information about class hierarchy in the guest code, evolving as new classes are loaded.WebAssembly  This release is marked by significant performance improvements in GraalVM WebAssembly implementation based on our benchmarks:          Internal AST memory footprint improvements 3.18x      Peak performance improvements 1.24xs      Polyglot Embedding  Added the ability to spawn a native-image isolate for each Engine or Context in a native launcher or library. This feature was previously supported only for the JVM deployment. GraalVM Enterprise only  Added Value.hasMetaParents() and Value.getMetaParents() methods that allow lookup of the hierarchy of parents for meta objects (for example, a super class or implemented interface of Java classes).  Added HostAccess.Builder.allowAccessInheritance to inherit access to methods that have been explicitly exported in an interface or superclass versus only explicitly vetted method implementations (for example, via @HostAccess.Export).  Added List#add support for polyglot values that are mapped to java.util.List.A full list of changes is available in the changelog.Truffle Language and Tool Implementations  Added new static APIs to com.oracle.truffle.api.frame.Frame:          Implemented a new static option to FrameSlotKind for index-based slots. Frame slots using this kind cannot be changed to another kind later on. Static frame slots can simultaneously hold one primitive and one object value. Static frame slots are intended for situations where the type of a variable in frame slots is known ahead of time and does not need any type checks (for example, in statically typed languages).      Static frame slots are intended for situations where the type of a variable in a frame slots is known ahead-of-time and does not need any type checks (for example, in statically typed languages).        The Static Object Model offers preliminary support for field-based storage also for GraalVM Native Image.  Truffle IGV dumping with log level 5 (-Dgraal.Dump=Truffle:5) now dumps the graph after each method that was fully partially evaluated. This enables debugging of problems only visible during partial evaluation.A full list of updates can be found in the changelog.Tools  Improved building native images on Windows with our GraalVM for Java VS Code Extension. Now, .gradlew nativeBuild on Windows 10 runs inside x64 Native Tools Command Prompt.  GraalVM Updater can now produce JSON output for the available, list, and info commands, which makes it easier for other tools such as the GraalVM for Java VS Code Extension to programmatically use it.",

GraalVM Community releases from the 21.x branch are end-of-life. See the Version Roadmap for the release schedule and the new GraalVM Community Roadmap for upcoming features.  Released experimental JDK 19 GraalVM builds including the Graal compiler, Native Image, and all GraalVM languages and tools except Espresso (Java on Truffle). These builds enable users to take advantage of the latest JDK 18 and JDK 19 features such as Virtual Threads, the Simple Web Server, Structured Concurrency, and more. Support for JDK 19 will be available in a future release. See #4957 and #5063.  Reduced the GraalVM Native Image installable file size by around 80MB: the LLVM backend is now shipped as a separate native-image-llvm-backend component (no longer shipped by default with native-image).      Released the LLVM runtime for GraalVM Community Edition for Windows under experimental support.    Updated the OpenJDK release on which GraalVM Community Edition is built to:          11.0.17 for Java 11-based GraalVM Community.

See Java SE 11 Release Notes      17.0.5 for Java 17-based GraalVM Enterprise. See Java SE 17 Release Notes      19.0.1 for Java  19-based GraalVM Community. See Java SE 19 Release Notes      Java and Compiler Updates  Added support for JDK 18 and JDK 19 features such as Virtual Threads, the Simple Web Server, Structured Concurrency, and more in the GraalVM based on JDK 19 builds.  Improved JIT compilation isolation by using one isolate per the libgraal compiler thread. This avoids all GC interference between the compiler threads which reduces GC pauses during compilation. This translates to improved compilation speed in general. On the DaCapo benchmarks, compilation as measured in bytecodes-per-second at least doubled, with individual benchmarks such as fop and pmd showing a 3x speed up. To enable the old mode, add -XX:JVMCINativeLibraryThreadFraction=0.66 -XX:JVMCIThreadsPerNativeLibraryRuntime=0 to the command line.  Added a dedicated Native Image GC policy for libgraal that will adjust the Eden space aggressively to minimize RSS memory usage.  Improved jlink behavior so that it produces images which use the Graal compiler (libgraal) as the top-tier compiler. A jlink-ed image produced from GraalVM uses JVMCI by default, and java -version output is GraalVM-branded.  Enabled StripMineCountedLoops and EarlyGVN compiler optimizations by default. These were first introduced in the 22.2 release with the -Dgraal.StripMineCountedLoops=true and -Dgraal.EarlyGVN=true options.  Implemented loop vectorization for integer min/max operations. This implementation handles all integer sizes, hand-written min/max patterns (for example, x &amp;gt; y ? x : y, not just Math.min/Math.max), unsigned min/max, and fold-shaped loops (for example, computing the minimum or maximum element of an array).  Removed the deprecated JMX HotSpotGraalRuntime management bean from both libgraal and jargraal.Native Image  Added support for JDK 19 and OpenJDK Project Loom Virtual Threads (JEP 425): virtual threads for high-throughput lightweight concurrency are supported with both the Serial GC and the G1 GC. Since virtual threads are a preview feature in JDK 19, they are also a preview feature for GraalVM Native Image. They can be enabled with the new option --enable-preview. Virtual threads are not available on GraalVM based on JDK 11 and JDK 17, and they are not available yet for native executables that contain a Truffle language (JavaScript, Python, etc.). See #4920 for more details.  Identified and added missing parts in the Native Image API: functionality where applications and frameworks reached into internals of the native-image generator. It includes a new public API for programmatic registration of JNI, Resource, Proxy, and Serialization classes from Feature interface classes, and moving annotations for method substitutions to the Graal SDK. Even though these annotations are not supported APIs, for practical reasons they can now be used without depending on the native-image generator. For this release, the native-image internals are still published to Maven Central, but this will be stopped in a future release. We therefore encourage all users to only rely on the Graal SDK starting with this release, and if this is not possible, report further missing API on GitHub.  Update the G1 GC version that is available in Native Image to JDK 19. This G1 version is also used for native executables based on JDK 11 and JDK 17. In addition, the G1 GC can now be used with native executables that are statically linked with the musl C library.  Added RuntimeResourceAccess#addResource(Module module, String resourcePath, byte[] resource) API method that enables resources to be injected into native executables.Debugging and monitoring experience improvements:  Improved the debugging experience to identify memory usage and memory leaks (contributed by Red Hat). For example, perf report is able to associate code addresses sampled during a perf record session with Java methods and print the DWARF-derived method name for the method in its output histogram. Read more about special considerations for using perf and valgrind in the documentation.  Added the --enable-monitoring=&amp;lt;all,heapdump,jfr,jvmstat&amp;gt; option to enable fine-grained control over monitoring features included in native executables. The old option -H:±AllowVMInspection should no longer be used. The new option is part of the supported API.  Added initial support for jvmstat to GraalVM Community Edition. Previously, this was available in GraalVM Enterprise Edition only.  Added support for the JFR events JavaMonitorEnter, JavaMonitorWait, and ThreadSleep (contributed by Red Hat).  Add the option --enable-sbom to the supported API. The old non-API option -H:IncludeSBOM should no longer be used.Build output enhancements:  Introduced the experimental -H:BuildOutputJSONFile=&amp;lt;file.json&amp;gt; option to export build output information in JSON format. In addition, the old build output style and the -H:±BuildOutputUseNewStyle option are removed.  Added the --silent option to silence the build output.GraalVM Native Image ecosystem updates:  Spring Boot 3.0.0-M5 comes with improved AOT processing and GraalVM Native Image support.  JUnit framework 5.9.1 introduced the @EnabledInNativeImage and @DisabledInNativeImage annotations to enable users to include/exclude testing GraalVM native executables.  Micronaut added a new Test Resources feature with support for GraalVM Native Image.  IntelliJ IDEA 2022.2 has added experimental support for debugging GraalVM Native Image executables.Known Issues with JDK 19 SupportNote that the java.io.Console API does not work properly on JDK 19: The information whether or not a Console is available is wrongly computed at build time. This means that, for example, when building a native executable on a CI system without a terminal, the executable will not have a Console available even when running inside a terminal. This also affects the Truffle language launchers that are shipped with GraalVM.The project changelog is available on GitHub.Polyglot Runtime  Introduced the SnippetRun#getException() method that provides an IllegalArgumentException thrown during snippet execution. IllegalArgumentException is converted to a PolyglotException before it is returned.A full list of updates can be found in the changelog.JavaScript and Node.js  Implemented the WebAssembly multi-value proposal to add support for returning multiple values to WebAssembly.  Updated Node.js to version 16.16.0.  Enabled ECMA-402 Internationalization API by default. It can be disabled using the --js.intl-402=false option.  Added an experimental option --js.unhandled-rejections=handler that enables using a custom callback to track unhandled promise rejections.  Implemented the Decorators (stage 3) proposal.The project changelog is available on GitHub.Python  Renamed the entire project from GraalPython to GraalPy, and the launcher from graalpython to graalpy. This change also updates GraalVM’s launchers to include symlinks from python and python3 to graalpy for better integration with other tools.Performance improvements:  Switched to the new bytecode interpreter by default. This change brings better startup performance and memory footprint while retaining good JIT-compiled performance. For example, the development time actions such as pip install &amp;lt;package&amp;gt; or running import &amp;lt;package&amp;gt; in the REPL are now 20-25% faster and use around 25% less memory on average.Compatibility improvements:  Switched to a new parser generated from CPython’s new PEG grammar definition. It brings better compatibility and enables us to implement the ast module.  Added support for Tracing API (sys.settrace), which makes pdb and related tools work on GraalPy.  Added support for Profiling API (sys.setprofile), which makes the profile package work.  Updated pip to automatically choose the best version for known packages. You can use pip install pandas, and pip will select the versions of pandas and numpy that is tested in the GraalPy continuous integration.  Added support for Flask.  Implemented PEP 405 for full support of virtual environments. This fixes issues with the virtualenv package and tox that are used in PyCharm or in many projects’ continuous integration (CI) jobs.A full list of updates can be found in the changelog.RubyNew features:  Foreign strings now have all methods of Ruby String. They are treated as #frozen? UTF-8 Ruby Strings.  Added the Java.add_to_classpath method to add JAR paths at runtime. It enables users to modify the JVM classpath when running in the JVM mode (--jvm). For example, a Ruby gem, managed via Bundler, loads a Java library can update the classpath itself. See #2693 for more details.  Added support for Ruby 3.1’s Hash shorthand and punning syntax, and anonymous block forwarding syntax.  Added the following keyword arguments to Polyglot::InnerContext.new: languages, language_options, inherit_all_access, code_sharing.Performance-related improvements:  Improved interpreter performance by optimizing for better host inlining.  Used poll instead of select for simple IO waiting to reduce overheads (#1584).  Improved interoperability with Java: no more conversion between Java Strings and Ruby Strings at the interop boundary.Compatibility updates:  Added support for #dup and #clone on foreign strings.  Implemented rb_ivar_foreach to iterate over instance and class variables like in CRuby. See #2701 for more details.Changes:  Removed Truffle::Interop.{import_without_conversion,export_without_conversion}. Use Polyglot.{import,export} instead.  Removed Truffle::Interop.members_without_conversion. Use Truffle::Interop.members instead.A full list of changes is available in the changelog.R  Implemented the global native variable API to improve R graphics isolation when using multiple R contexts. Users can now use a native package from two R contexts at the same time. The API consists of several upcalls, named with the FASTR_GlobalVar prefix, for example, FASTR_GlobalVarAlloc. Currently, only grid and graphics built-in packages are refactored to use the global native variable API.  Added partial support for dplyr 1.0.3 to enable users to work with data frames such as objects, both in memory and out of memory. The SET_PRCODE, SET_PRENV, and SET_PRVALUE upcalls are now implemented.The project changelog is available on GitHub.LLVM Runtime  Updated LLVM toolchain to version 14.0.6.  Released the LLVM runtime for GraalVM Community Edition for Windows under experimental support.  Improved support for the x86 extended precision for floating-point numbers. It is now possible to call native functions (for example, libc) with long double arguments on the x86 architecture. The long double variants of math.h functions now use full precision. Previously they were implemented using double arithmetic.Java on Truffle (Espresso)  Added the polyglot automatic interface type mapping for 1:1 mappings between a host and an embedded guest context.  Improved interoperability: when an Espresso-to-Espresso conversion was seen, then an Espresso-to-primitive conversion happens. The latter would fail.  Methods from Espresso objects can now be read to obtain a new interop executable object, isExecutable.  Fixed exit status on uncaught exceptions in the main thread.  Added the addPath invokable member to Espresso bindings (polyglot.getBindings(&quot;espresso&quot;), the entry point where class loading happens) if java.UseBindingsLoader=true. It enables adding a new path to the classloader associated with the bindings. It was a necessary addition to better control the behavior of Espresso when going through the Truffle TCK.The project changelog is available on GitHub.WebAssembly  Implemented the Multi-Value proposal. It can be disabled with the option --wasm.MultiValue=false.  Enabled the Sign-Extension-Ops and Saturating-Float-To-Int conversions by default.The project changelog is available on GitHub.Polyglot Embedding  Implemented the FieldValueTransformer API as a more generic mechanism to intercept and constant fold field values (replaces the existing RecomputeFieldValue for the kind Custom). It allows modifying the value of a particular field if it is marked as a transformer with BeforeAnalysisAccess#registerFieldValueTransformer. A transformer must be registered before the field is seen reachable by the static analysis, and only one transformer per field. At build time, the field value transformer provides the value of the field for the image heap. Without a transformer, the value of the field in the image heap is the same as the hosted. This API is necessary for compatibility with Spring.  Added Context.Builder.allowInnerContextOptions(boolean) which enables the context to spawn inner contexts and modify and override language options. Inner contexts no longer share code with the initial context. The default value for this privilege is determined according to whether Context.Builder.allowAllPrivilages(boolean) is set or not. Do not enable this privilege in security-sensitive scenarios.  Moved Native Image strictly-internal annotation classes from com.oracle.svm.core.annotate to (@Alias, @TargetClass, @Substitute, etc.) to org.graalvm.sdk module.A full list of changes is available in the changelog.Truffle Language and Tool Implementations  Tuned the host inlining heuristic for reduced code size. A new host inlining tuning guide is available in the documentation.  Added new capabilities to TruffleContext, for example, TruffleContext.Builder.forceSharing(Boolean) to force or deny code sharing for inner contexts, and many others. Check the Truffle project changelog to see a full list.  Removed several deprecated core APIs, for example, FrameSlot, CompilerOptions, etc. Check the Truffle project changelog to see a full list.  Added TruffleInstrument.Env#createSystemThread and TruffleLanguage.Env#createSystemThread to create a new thread designed to process instrument tasks in the background.  Added copyStatic, clearStatic and swap...Static additional methods to the Static Frame API.  Added a check if the static frame access is validated when assertions are enabled. Reading a slot with a different type than written to leads to an AssertionError.  Deprecated the TruffleLanguage.Env.newContextBuilder() method and replaced it with a new method TruffleLanguage.Env.newInnerContextBuilder(String...). The new method no longer inherits all privileges from the parent context and no longer initializes the creator context by default. The new method also allows setting the permitted languages for the inner context similarly to the Polyglot Embedding API.  Changed the behavior of setting application arguments: inner contexts no longer inherit application arguments from their outer context. Now you can set application arguments explicitly for inner contexts using TruffleContext.Builder.arguments(String, String[]).  Modified behavior of inner contexts: an inner context no longer uses system exit on exit, even if the polyglot embedder specified it with Context.Builder.useSystemExit(boolean) for an outer context.  Introduced the RootNode.getParentFrameDescriptor method to support identifying lexical scope parents of hot methods and compiling them earlier.A full list of updates can be found in the changelog.",

          "content": "Truffle AOT TutorialMany statically compiled languages, like C are designed to be compilable without prior execution.By default, Truffle first interprets code before it is compiled.In order to improve warmup speed of static languages AOT compilation can be supported.The following tutorial describes how to support Truffle AOT in your language, how to trigger and test it.Language SupportIn order for languages to support AOT compilation the language needs to implement the RootNode.prepareForAOT() method.The language implementation can indicate support for AOT by returning a non null value in this method.The goal for implementing a root node for AOT is to prepare all the AST nodes such that they no longer deoptimize when they are compiled without prior execution.Typical actions performed in an implementation of this method are:  Initialize local variable types in the FrameDescriptor of the root node. If a language uses local variables and their types are known, then this information must be provided to the FrameDescriptor. This step can often be done already during parsing.  Compute the expected execution signature of a root node and return it. This step requires the parser to infer expected typesfor arguments and return values.  Prepare specializing nodes with profiles that do not invalidate on first execution. Truffle DSL supports preparation of specializing nodes for AOT. See the example AOT language for details.Trigger AOT compilationAOT compilation can be triggered and tested by using the --engine.CompileAOTOnCreate=true option.This will trigger AOT compilation for every created call target with a root node that supports AOT compilation.A root node supports AOT compilation if it returns a non null value in RootNode.prepareForAOT().Note that enabling this flag will also disable background compilation which makes it not suitable for production usage.Example UsageUse the following documented and executable Truffle language as inspiration for AOT support:AOT TutorialThe example is executable as mx unittest using mx unittest AOTTutorial.",

          "title": "Truffle AOT Overview",
          "content": "Truffle AOT OverviewThere are several different flavors of AOT preinitialization, compilation, and caching supported in Truffle.This document is intended to provide an overview of these capabilities.Note that some of the features mentioned here are only supported in Oracle GraalVM.Preinitialization of the First ContextNative image allows running Java code in static initializers at image build time.After static initialization was run, values referenced from static fields are snapshotted and persisted in the image.Context preinitialization leverages this feature by creating and initializing a language context at image build time to be used by the first context that gets created in an isolate or process at runtime.This typically improves the initialization time of the first context significantly.Context preinitialization can be enabled by setting the system property -Dpolyglot.image-build-time.PreinitializeContexts=ruby,llvm at image build time.A language needs to implement TruffleLanguage.patchContext and return true to support context preinitialization.In addition, languages need to be careful not to bind any host-specific data or create objects that would not be allowed to be stored in a native image, like java.lang.Thread instances.For more information see TruffleLanguage.patchContext javadoc.Code sharing within the same Isolate/ProcessA polyglot engine can be used in order to determine the scope of code sharing between contexts.An example of how that can be done can be found in the reference manual.When a language is initialized for a polyglot context, a new language instance is requested from an engine.If the language supports ContextPolicy.SHARED, then the language instance will be reused for an engine instance.The source parsing cache is associated with a language instance, so parsing happens once per language instance.Languages may choose to disallow reuse of a language instance for a new additional context by implementing TruffleLanguage.areOptionsCompatible.This allows languages to assume specific context options to be compilation final for all root nodes created by the language.An exception from this rule is InteropLibrary, where nodes may be shared unconditionally between languages instances.Supporting Context Independent CodeCodesharing requires that all code data structures are independent of their context.For example, code is context-independent if it can be executed with one context and then executed again with a new context without deoptimizing the code.A good test to verify a language implementation’s context independence is to create a context with an explicit engine, run a test application, and then verify that the second context does not cause deoptimizations when running the same deterministic application.The Truffle framework announces the potential use of a language instance in multiple contexts by calling TruffleLanguage.initializeMultipleContexts, typically even before the first context is created.The framework is able to initialize multiple contexts before the first context is created when an explicit engine is used or --engine.CacheStore is set to true.The following criteria should be satisfied when supporting context independent code:  All speculation on runtime value identity must be disabled with multiple contexts initialized, as they will lead to a guaranteed deoptimization when used with the second context.  Function inline caches should be modified and implemented as a two-level inline cache. The first level speculates on the function instance’s identity and the second level on the underlying CallTarget instance. The first level cache must be disabled if multiple contexts are initialized, as this would unnecessarily cause deoptimization.  The DynamicObject root Shape instance should be stored in the language instance instead of the language context. Otherwise, any inline cache on shapes will not stabilize and ultimately end up in the generic state.  All Node implementations must not store context-dependent data structures or context-dependent runtime values.  Loading and parsing of sources, even with language-internal builtins, should be performed using TruffleLanguage.Env.parse to cache Source parsing per language instance.  All assumption instances should be stored in the language instance instead of the context. With multiple contexts initialized, the context instance read using context references may no longer be a constant. In this case any assumption read from the context would not be folded and they would cause significant runtime performance overhead. Assumptions from the language can be folded by the compiler in both single and multiple context mode.It is expected that an AST created for multiple contexts is compiled to less efficient machine code as it does not allow for speculation on the identity of runtime values.For example, instead of speculating on the function instance in an inline cache, it is necessary to speculate on the contained CallTarget.This is slower because it requires an additional read to access the CallTarget stored in the function.It may be costly to create context independent code, therefore, speculation on runtime values should still be performed if multiple contexts are not initialized.SimpleLanguage and JavaScript are two languages that already support context independent code and might be useful as a guidance on concrete problems.Persistent Context Independent Code with Auxiliary Engine Caching (Oracle GraalVM)Oracle GraalVM supports persisting code data structures to disk.This enables to almost eliminate warmup time for the first run of an application in an isolate/process.The SVM auxiliary image feature is used to persist and load the necessary data structures to the disk.Persisting the image can take a significant amount of time as compilation needs to be performed.However, loading is designed to be as fast as possible, typically almost instantaneous.Engine caching is enabled using options and functional even if the context was created without an explicit engine.More information on engine caching can be found in the engine caching tutorial.Compilation without ProfilingBy default, if language functions are created but never executed, they are not compiled when they are stored in an auxiliary engine cache image.Auxiliary engine caching supports triggering compilation for root nodes that were loaded but never executed.In such a case the framework calls the RootNode.prepareForAOT method.More information on making a language implementation ready for compilation without prior execution can be found in the AOT tutorial.Note that not every language can be compiled without prior execution and produce efficient machine code.Statically typed languages are typically more suitable for this.Application SnapshottingIt is planned to also support persisting runtime values of polyglot context instances to disk.More information will appear here as soon as this feature is implemented.",

          "title": "Collect Metadata with the Tracing Agent",
          "content": "Collect Metadata with the Tracing AgentThe Native Image tool relies on the static analysis of an application’s reachable code at runtime. However, the analysis cannot always completely predict all usages of the Java Native Interface (JNI), Java Reflection, Dynamic Proxy objects, or class path resources. Undetected usages of these dynamic features must be provided to the native-image tool in the form of metadata (precomputed in code or as JSON configuration files).Here you will find information how to automatically collect metadata for an application and write JSON configuration files.To learn how to compute dynamic feature calls in code, see Reachability Metadata.Table of Contents  Tracing Agent  Conditional Metadata Collection  Agent Advanced Usage  Native Image Configure ToolTracing AgentGraalVM provides a Tracing Agent to easily gather metadata and prepare configuration files. The agent tracks all usages of dynamic features during application execution on a regular Java VM.Enable the agent on the command line with the java command from the GraalVM JDK:$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=/path/to/config-dir/ ...  Note: -agentlib must be specified before a -jar option or a class name or any application parameters as part of the java command.When run, the agent looks up classes, methods, fields, resources for which the native-image tool needs additional information.When the application completes and the JVM exits, the agent writes metadata to JSON files in the specified output directory (/path/to/config-dir/).It may be necessary to run the application more than once (with different execution paths) for improved coverage of dynamic features.The config-merge-dir option adds to an existing set of configuration files, as follows:$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-merge-dir=/path/to/config-dir/ ...                                                              ^^^^^The agent also provides the following options to write metadata on a periodic basis:  config-write-period-secs=n: writes metadata files every n seconds; n must be greater than 0.  config-write-initial-delay-secs=n: waits n seconds before first writing metadata; defaults to 1.For example:$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=/path/to/config-dir/,config-write-period-secs=300,config-write-initial-delay-secs=5 ...The above command will write metadata files to /path/to/config-dir/ every 300 seconds after an initial delay of 5 seconds.It is advisable to manually review the generated configuration files.Because the agent observes only executed code, the application input should cover as many code paths as possible.The generated configuration files can be supplied to the native-image tool by placing them in a META-INF/native-image/ directory on the class path. This directory (or any of its subdirectories) is searched for files with the names jni-config.json, reflect-config.json, proxy-config.json, resource-config.json, predefined-classes-config.json, serialization-config.json which are then automatically included in the build process. Not all of those files must be present. When multiple files with the same name are found, all of them are considered.To test the agent collecting metadata on an example application, go to the Build a Native Executable with Reflection guide.Conditional Metadata CollectionThe agent can deduce metadata conditions based on their usage in executed code.Conditional metadata is mainly aimed towards library maintainers with the goal of reducing overall footprint.To collect conditional metadata with the agent, see Conditional Metadata Collection.Agent Advanced UsageCaller-based FiltersBy default, the agent filters dynamic accesses which Native Image supports without configuration.The filter mechanism works by identifying the Java method performing the access, also referred to as caller method, and matching its declaring class against a sequence of filter rules.The built-in filter rules exclude dynamic accesses which originate in the JVM, or in parts of a Java class library directly supported by Native Image (such as java.nio) from the generated configuration files.Which item (class, method, field, resource, etc.) is being accessed is not relevant for filtering.In addition to the built-in filter, custom filter files with additional rules can be specified using the caller-filter-file option.For example: -agentlib:caller-filter-file=/path/to/filter-file,config-output-dir=...Filter files have the following structure:{ &quot;rules&quot;: [    {&quot;excludeClasses&quot;: &quot;com.oracle.svm.**&quot;},    {&quot;includeClasses&quot;: &quot;com.oracle.svm.tutorial.*&quot;},    {&quot;excludeClasses&quot;: &quot;com.oracle.svm.tutorial.HostedHelper&quot;}  ],  &quot;regexRules&quot;: [    {&quot;includeClasses&quot;: &quot;.*&quot;},    {&quot;excludeClasses&quot;: &quot;.*$$Generated[0-9]+&quot;}  ]}The rules section contains a sequence of rules.Each rule specifies either includeClasses, which means that lookups originating in matching classes will be included in the resulting configuration, or excludeClasses, which excludes lookups originating in matching classes from the configuration.Each rule defines a pattern to match classes. The pattern can end in .* or .**, interpreted as follows:    - .* matches all classes in the package and only that package;    - .** matches all classes in the package as well as in all subpackages at any depth. Without .* or .**, the rule applies only to a single class with the qualified name that matches the pattern.All rules are processed in the sequence in which they are specified, so later rules can partially or entirely override earlier ones.When multiple filter files are provided (by specifying multiple caller-filter-file options), their rules are chained together in the order in which the files are specified.The rules of the built-in caller filter are always processed first, so they can be overridden in custom filter files.In the example above, the first rule excludes lookups originating in all classes from package com.oracle.svm and from all of its subpackages (and their subpackages, etc.) from the generated metadata.In the next rule however, lookups from those classes that are directly in package com.oracle.svm.tutorial are included again.Finally, lookups from the HostedHelper class is excluded again. Each of these rules partially overrides the previous ones.For example, if the rules were in the reverse order, the exclusion of com.oracle.svm.** would be the last rule and would override all other rules.The regexRules section also contains a sequence of rules.Its structure is the same as that of the rules section, but rules are specified as regular expression patterns which are matched against the entire fully qualified class identifier.The regexRules section is optional.If a regexRules section is specified, a class will be considered included if (and only if) both rules and regexRules include the class and neither of them exclude it.With no regexRules section, only the rules section determines whether a class is included or excluded.For testing purposes, the built-in filter for Java class library lookups can be disabled by adding the no-builtin-caller-filter option, but the resulting metadata files are generally unsuitable for the build.Similarly, the built-in filter for Java VM-internal accesses based on heuristics can be disabled with no-builtin-heuristic-filter and will also generally lead to less usable metadata files.For example: -agentlib:native-image-agent=no-builtin-caller-filter,no-builtin-heuristic-filter,config-output-dir=...Access FiltersUnlike the caller-based filters described above, which filter dynamic accesses based on where they originate, access filters apply to the target of the access.Therefore, access filters enable directly excluding packages and classes (and their members) from the generated configuration.By default, all accessed classes (which also pass the caller-based filters and the built-in filters) are included in the generated configuration.Using the access-filter-file option, a custom filter file that follows the file structure described above can be added.The option can be specified more than once to add multiple filter files and can be combined with the other filter options, for example, -agentlib:access-filter-file=/path/to/access-filter-file,caller-filter-file=/path/to/caller-filter-file,config-output-dir=....Specify Configuration Files as ArgumentsA directory containing configuration files that is not part of the class path can be specified to native-image via -H:ConfigurationFileDirectories=/path/to/config-dir/.This directory must directly contain all files: jni-config.json, reflect-config.json, proxy-config.json and resource-config.json.A directory with the same metadata files that is on the class path, but not in META-INF/native-image/, can be provided via -H:ConfigurationResourceRoots=path/to/resources/.Both -H:ConfigurationFileDirectories and -H:ConfigurationResourceRoots can also take a comma-separated list of directories.Injecting the Agent via the Process EnvironmentAltering the java command line to inject the agent can prove to be difficult if the Java process is launched by an application or script file, or if Java is even embedded in an existing process.In that case, it is also possible to inject the agent via the JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS environment variable.This environment variable can be picked up by multiple Java processes which run at the same time, in which case each agent must write to a separate output directory with config-output-dir.(The next section describes how to merge sets of configuration files.)In order to use separate paths with a single global JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS variable, the agent’s output path options support placeholders:export JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=&quot;-agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=/path/to/config-output-dir-{pid}-{datetime}/&quot;The {pid} placeholder is replaced with the process identifier, while {datetime} is replaced with the system date and time in UTC, formatted according to ISO 8601. For the above example, the resulting path could be: /path/to/config-output-dir-31415-20181231T235950Z/.Trace FilesIn the examples above, native-image-agent has been used to both keep track of the dynamic accesses on a JVM and then to generate a set of configuration files from them.However, for a better understanding of the execution, the agent can also write a trace file in JSON format that contains each individual access:$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -agentlib:native-image-agent=trace-output=/path/to/trace-file.json ...The native-image-configure tool can transform trace files to configuration files.The following command reads and processes trace-file.json and generates a set of configuration files in the directory /path/to/config-dir/:native-image-configure generate --trace-input=/path/to/trace-file.json --output-dir=/path/to/config-dir/InteroperabilityThe agent uses the JVM Tool Interface (JVMTI) and can potentially be used with other JVMs that support JVMTI.In this case, it is necessary to provide the absolute path of the agent:/path/to/some/java -agentpath:/path/to/graalvm/jre/lib/amd64/libnative-image-agent.so=&amp;lt;options&amp;gt; ...Experimental OptionsThe agent has options which are currently experimental and might be enabled in future releases, but can also be changed or removed entirely.See the ExperimentalAgentOptions.md guide.Native Image Configure ToolWhen using the agent in multiple processes at the same time as described in the previous section, config-output-dir is a safe option, but it results in multiple sets of configuration files.The native-image-configure tool can be used to merge these configuration files:native-image-configure generate --input-dir=/path/to/config-dir-0/ --input-dir=/path/to/config-dir-1/ --output-dir=/path/to/merged-config-dir/This command reads one set of configuration files from /path/to/config-dir-0/ and another from /path/to/config-dir-1/ and then writes a set of configuration files that contains both of their information to /path/to/merged-config-dir/.An arbitrary number of --input-dir arguments with sets of configuration files can be specified.

          "title": "Auxiliary Engine Caching",
          "content": "Auxiliary Engine CachingThe following document describes how the auxiliary engine cache of GraalVM works.This feature is only available in Oracle GraalVM. In GraalVM Community Edition, these options are not available.IntroductionWarmup of Truffle guest language programs can take a significant amount of time.Warmup consists of work that is repeated every time a program is executed until peak performance is reached.This includes:  Loading and parsing the guest application into Truffle AST data structures.  Execution and profiling of the guest application in the interpreter.  Compilation of the AST to machine code.Within a single OS process, the work performed during warmup can be shared by specifying an explicit engine.This requires language implementations to disable context-related optimizations to avoid deoptimizations between contexts that share code.Auxiliary engine caching builds upon the mechanism for disabling context-related optimizations and adds the capability to persist an engine with ASTs and optimized machine code to disk.This way, the work performed during warmup can be significantly reduced in the first application context of a new process.We use the SVM auxiliary image feature to persist and load the necessary data structures to the disk.Persisting the image can take significant time as compilation needs to be performed.However, loading is designed to be as fast as possible, typically almost instantaneous.This reduces the warmup time of an application significantly.Getting StartedStarting from Oracle GraalVM installation, you first need to (re)build an image with auxiliary engine caching capabilities.For example, one can rebuild the JavaScript image by adding the auxiliary engine cache feature:graalvm/bin/native-image --macro:js-launcher -H:+AuxiliaryEngineCache -H:ReservedAuxiliaryImageBytes=1073741824The --macro argument value depends on the guest languageBy default, auxiliary images of up to 1GB are possible.The maximum size can be increased or decreased as needed.The amount of reserved bytes does not actually impact the memory consumed by the application.In future versions, the auxiliary engine cache will be enabled by default when the --macro:js-launcher macro is used.After rebuilding the JavaScript launcher, the feature is used as follows:Create a new file fib.js:function fib(n) {   if (n == 1 || n == 2) {       return 1;   }   return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);}console.log(fib(32))In order to persist the engine of a profiling run to disk use the following command line:graalvm/bin/js --experimental-options --engine.TraceCache=true --engine.CacheStore=fib.image fib.jsThe ` –engine.TraceCache=true` option is optional and allows you to see what is going on.The output is as follows:[engine] [cache] No load engine cache configured.2178309[engine] [cache] Preparing engine for store (compile policy hot)...[engine] [cache] Force compile targets mode: hot[engine] [cache] Prepared engine in 1 ms.[engine] [cache] Persisting engine for store ...[engine] [cache] Persisted engine in 20 ms.[engine] [cache] Detecting changes (update policy always)...[engine] [cache]     New image contains         1 sources and  82 function roots.[engine] [cache]     Always persist policy.[engine] [cache] Writing image to fib.image...[engine] [cache] Finished writing 1,871,872 bytes in 4 ms.The engine can now be loaded from disk using the following command:graalvm/bin/js --experimental-options --engine.TraceCache --engine.CacheLoad=fib.image fib.jswhich prints:[engine] [cache] Try loading image &#39;./fib.image&#39;...[engine] [cache] Loaded image in 0 ms. 1,871,872 bytes   1 sources  82 roots[engine] [cache] Engine from image successfully patched with new options.2178309[engine] [cache] No store engine cache configured.Since there is no need to warm up the application, the application’s execution time should be significantly improved.UsageThe cache store and load operations can be controlled using the following options:  --engine.Cache=&amp;lt;path&amp;gt; Loads and stores the cached engine from/to  path.  --engine.CacheStore=&amp;lt;path&amp;gt; Stores the cached engine to  path.  --engine.CacheLoad=&amp;lt;path&amp;gt; Loads the cached engine from path.  --engine.CachePreinitializeContext=&amp;lt;boolean&amp;gt; Preinitialize a new context in the image (default true).  --engine.TraceCache=&amp;lt;boolean&amp;gt; Enables debug output.  --engine.TraceCompilation=&amp;lt;boolean&amp;gt; Prints forced compilations.The compilation of roots may be forced when an image is stored using the --engine.CacheCompile=&amp;lt;policy&amp;gt; option. The supported policies are:  none: No compilations will be persisted, and existing compilations will be invalidated.  compiled: No compilations will be forced, but finished compilations will be persisted.  hot: All started compilations will be completed and then persisted. (default)  aot: All started, and AOT compilable roots will be forced to compile and persisted.  executed: All executed and all AOT compilable roots will be forced to compile.By default, all started compilations in the compile queue will be completed and then persisted.Whether a function root is AOT compilable is determined by the language.A language supports AOT by implementing RootNode.prepareForAOT().An update policy can be specified if both load and store operations are set using the --engine.UpdatePolicy=&amp;lt;policy&amp;gt; option.Available policies are:  always Always persist.  newsource Store if new source was loaded that was not contained in the previously loaded image.  newroot Store if a new root was loaded and not contained in the previously loaded image.  never Never persist.Known Restrictions      There are generally no restrictions on the kind of applications that can be persisted.If the language supports a shared context policy, auxiliary engine caching should work.If the language does not support it, then no data will be persisted.        The persisted auxiliary engine image can only be used with the same SVM native image that it was created with.Using the engine image with any other native-image will fail.        There can only be one active auxiliary image per native-image isolate.Trying to load multiple auxiliary images at the same time will fail.Currently, auxiliary images can also not be unloaded, but it is planned to lift this restriction in the future.  Security ConsiderationsAll data that is persisted to disk represents code only and no application context-specific data like global variables.However, profiled ASTs and code may contain artifacts of the optimizations performed in a Truffle AST.For example, it is possible that runtime strings are used for optimizations and therefore persisted to an engine image.Development and Debugging on NativeImageThere are several options useful for debugging auxiliary engines caching when running on NativeImage:  -XX:+TraceAuxiliaryImageClassHistogram Prints a class histogram of all the objects contained in an image when persisting.  -XX:+TraceAuxiliaryImageReferenceTree Prints a class reference tree of all the objects contained in an image when persisting.Development and Debugging on HotSpotIt can be useful to debug language implementation issues related to auxiliary image on HotSpot.On Oracle GraalVM in JVM mode, we have additional options that can be used to help debug issues with this feature:Since storing partial heaps on HotSpot is not supported, these debug features do not work on HotSpot.  --engine.DebugCacheStore=&amp;lt;boolean&amp;gt; Prepares the engine for caching and stores it to a static field instead of writing it to disk.  --engine.DebugCacheLoad=&amp;lt;boolean&amp;gt; Prepares the engine to use the engine stored in the static field instead of reading it from disk.  --engine.DebugCacheCompile=&amp;lt;boolean&amp;gt; Policy to use to force compilation for executed call targets before persisting the engine. This supports the same values as --engine.CacheCompile.  --engine.DebugCacheTrace=&amp;lt;boolean&amp;gt; Enables tracing for the engine cache debug feature.For example:js --experimental-options --engine.TraceCompilation --engine.DebugCacheTrace --engine.DebugCacheStore --engine.DebugCacheCompile=executed fib.jsPrints the following output:[engine] opt done         fib                                                         |ASTSize            32 |Time   231( 147+84  )ms |Tier             Last |DirectCallNodes I    6/D    8 |GraalNodes   980/ 1857 |CodeSize         7611 |CodeAddress 0x10e20e650 |Source       fib.js:22178309[engine] [cache] Preparing debug engine for storage...[engine] [cache] Force compile targets mode: executed[engine] [cache] Force compiling 4 roots for engine caching.[engine] opt done         @72fa3b00                                                   |ASTSize             3 |Time   211( 166+45  )ms |Tier             Last |DirectCallNodes I    2/D    1 |GraalNodes   500/ 1435 |CodeSize         4658 |CodeAddress 0x10e26c8d0 |Source            n/a[engine] opt done         :program                                                    |ASTSize            25 |Time   162( 123+39  )ms |Tier             Last |DirectCallNodes I    1/D    1 |GraalNodes   396/ 1344 |CodeSize         4407 |CodeAddress 0x10e27fd50 |Source       fib.js:1[engine] opt done         Console.log                                                 |ASTSize             3 |Time    26(  11+15  )ms |Tier             Last |DirectCallNodes I    0/D    0 |GraalNodes    98/  766 |CodeSize         2438 |CodeAddress 0x10e285710 |Source    &amp;lt;builtin&amp;gt;:1[engine] [cache] Stored debug engine in memory.This allows rapidly iterating on problems related to the compilation as well as to attach a Java debugger.A Java debugger can be attached using --vm.Xdebug --vm.Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=8000.Debugging the loading of persisted engines is more difficult as writing an engine to disk is not supported on HotSpot.However, it is possible to use the polyglot embedding API to simulate this use-case in a unit test.See the com.oracle.truffle.enterprise.test.DebugEngineCacheTest class as an example.",

          "content": "Truffle Branches InstrumentationIn languages implemented on top of Truffle, it is common that the AST implementations contain fast and slowexecution paths, usually based on some condition, such as a profile. These executionpaths are organized into different conditional branches. In these cases, it is oftenhelpful to know if running the program actually exercised the code in each of thoseexecutions paths.The branch instrumentation functionality instruments if-statements in target methodsto track which of the branches have been taken during execution. Branch instrumentationdoes this by instrumenting branches with code that writes to a globaltable. Each branch has an entry in this table. When the program ends, thecontents of the table are decoded and dumped to the standard output in readableform.There are several flags that control how branch instrumentation works. These flags arespecified as system properties:  --compiler.InstrumentBranches - controls whether instrumentation is on (trueor false, default is false)  --compiler.InstrumentFilter - filters methods in which instrumentationshould be done (method filter syntax, essentially &amp;lt;package&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;class&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;method&amp;gt;[.&amp;lt;signature&amp;gt;])  --compiler.InstrumentationTableSize - controls the maximum number ofinstrumented locations  --compiler.InstrumentBranchesPerInlineSite - controls whether instrumentationprovides separate branch profiles for each guest language function/compilation unit(default is false).Example UsageHere is an example of how to enable branch instrumentation on a program.When using instrumentation to detect hot or infrequently used branches in a Trufflelanguage implementation, it usually starts by finding a language node with aproblematic method. The following command runs a unit test for the SimpleLanguage,and instruments all the if-statements:mx --jdk jvmci sl --engine.BackgroundCompilation=false   --compiler.InstrumentBranches   &#39;--compiler.InstrumentFilter=*.*.*&#39;   ../truffle/truffle/com.oracle.truffle.sl.test/src/tests/LoopObjectDyn.slYou get the following output:Execution profile (sorted by hotness)=====================================  0: *****************************************************  1: **************************com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.access.SLPropertyCacheNode.namesEqual(SLPropertyCacheNode.java:109) [bci: 120][0] state = IF(if=36054#, else=0#)com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.controlflow.SLWhileRepeatingNode.executeRepeating(SLWhileRepeatingNode.java:102) [bci: 5][1] state = BOTH(if=18000#, else=18#)This output tells that both branches were visited in the if-statement in the fileSLWhileRepeatingNode.java at line 102, and only the true branch was visited forthe if-statement in the file SLPropertyCacheNode.java at line 109.However, it does not tell, e.g., where this specific SLPropertyCacheNode node wasused from – the same execute method can be called from many different SimpleLanguagenodes, and you may wish to distinguish these occurrences. Therefore, set theper-inline-site flag to true, and change the filter to focus only onSLPropertyCacheNode:mx --jdk jvmci sl -Djdk.graal.TruffleBackgroundCompilation=false   --compiler.InstrumentBranchesPerInlineSite   --compiler.InstrumentBranches   &#39;--compiler.InstrumentFilter=*.SLPropertyCacheNode.*&#39;   ../truffle/truffle/com.oracle.truffle.sl.test/src/tests/LoopObjectDyn.slThis time you get more output, because the method namesEqual was inlined atmultiple sites (each site is represented by its inlining chain). The following outputfragment first shows the histogram with the if-statement ID and its occurrencecount. It then shows the exact call stacks and execution counts for the branches.For example, for [1], when namesEqual is called from executeRead, the truebranch is taken 18018 times. When the namesEqual is called from executeWrite([0]), the true branch is taken only 18 times:Execution profile (sorted by hotness)=====================================  1: ***************************************  2: ***************************************  0:  3:com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.access.SLPropertyCacheNode.namesEqual(SLPropertyCacheNode.java:109) [bci: 120]com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.access.SLReadPropertyCacheNodeGen.executeRead(SLReadPropertyCacheNodeGen.java:76) [bci: 88]com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.access.SLReadPropertyNode.read(SLReadPropertyNode.java:71) [bci: 7]com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.access.SLReadPropertyNodeGen.executeGeneric(SLReadPropertyNodeGen.java:30) [bci: 35]com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.SLExpressionNode.executeLong(SLExpressionNode.java:81) [bci: 2]com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.expression.SLLessThanNodeGen.executeBoolean_long_long0(SLLessThanNodeGen.java:42) [bci: 5]com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.expression.SLLessThanNodeGen.executeBoolean(SLLessThanNodeGen.java:33) [bci: 14]com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.controlflow.SLWhileRepeatingNode.evaluateCondition(SLWhileRepeatingNode.java:133) [bci: 5]com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.controlflow.SLWhileRepeatingNode.executeRepeating(SLWhileRepeatingNode.java:102) [bci: 2]com.oracle.truffle.runtime.OptimizedOSRLoopNode.executeLoop(OptimizedOSRLoopNode.java:113) [bci: 61]com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.controlflow.SLWhileNode.executeVoid(SLWhileNode.java:69) [bci: 5]com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.controlflow.SLBlockNode.executeVoid(SLBlockNode.java:84) [bci: 37]com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.controlflow.SLFunctionBodyNode.executeGeneric(SLFunctionBodyNode.java:81) [bci: 5]com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.SLRootNode.execute(SLRootNode.java:78) [bci: 28][1] state = IF(if=18018#, else=0#)...com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.access.SLPropertyCacheNode.namesEqual(SLPropertyCacheNode.java:109) [bci: 120]com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.access.SLWritePropertyCacheNodeGen.executeWrite(SLWritePropertyCacheNodeGen.java:111) [bci: 244]com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.access.SLWritePropertyNode.write(SLWritePropertyNode.java:73) [bci: 9]com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.access.SLWritePropertyNodeGen.executeGeneric(SLWritePropertyNodeGen.java:33) [bci: 47]com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.access.SLWritePropertyNodeGen.executeVoid(SLWritePropertyNodeGen.java:41) [bci: 2]com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.controlflow.SLBlockNode.executeVoid(SLBlockNode.java:84) [bci: 37]com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.controlflow.SLFunctionBodyNode.executeGeneric(SLFunctionBodyNode.java:81) [bci: 5]com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.SLRootNode.execute(SLRootNode.java:78) [bci: 28][0] state = IF(if=18#, else=0#)...Truffle Call Boundary InstrumentationThe Truffle Call Boundary Instrumentation tool instruments callsites to methods thathave a TruffleCallBoundary annotation, and counts the calls to those methods.

The following properties are supported.ArgsUse this property if your project requires custom native-image command-line options to build correctly.For example, the native-image-configure-examples/configure-at-runtime-example contains Args = --initialize-at-build-time=com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty$Access in its native-image.properties file to ensure the class com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty$Access is initialized at executable build time.JavaArgsSometimes it can be necessary to provide custom options to the JVM that runs the native-image builder.Use the JavaArgs property in this case.ImageNameThis property specifies a user-defined name for the executable.If ImageName is not used, a name is automatically chosen:    * native-image -jar &amp;lt;name.jar&amp;gt; has a default executable name &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;    * native-image -cp ... fully.qualified.MainClass has a default executable name fully.qualified.mainclassNote that using ImageName does not prevent you from overriding the name via the command line.For example, if foo.bar contains ImageName=foo_app:    * native-image -jar foo.bar generates the executable foo_app but    * native-image -jar foo.bar application generates the executable applicationChanging the Default Configuration DirectoryNative Image by default stores configuration information in the user’s home directory: $HOME/.native-image/.To change this default, set the environment variable NATIVE_IMAGE_USER_HOME to a different location. For example:export NATIVE_IMAGE_USER_HOME= $HOME/.local/share/native-imageOrder of Arguments EvaluationThe options passed to native-image are evaluated from left to right.This also extends to options that are passed indirectly via configuration files in the META-INF/native-image directory.Consider the example where there is a JAR file that includes native-image.properties containing Args = -H:Optimize=0.You can override the setting that is contained in the JAR file by using the -H:Optimize=2 option after -cp &amp;lt;jar-file&amp;gt;.Memory Configuration for Native Image BuildThe native-image builder runs on a JVM and uses the memory management of the underlying platform.The usual Java command-line options for garbage collection apply to the native-image builder.During the creation of a native executable, the representation of the whole application is created to determine which classes and methods will be used at runtime.It is a computationally intensive process that uses the following default values for memory usage:-Xss10M -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=&amp;lt;percentage based on available memory&amp;gt; -XX:GCTimeRatio=19 -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError These defaults can be changed by passing -J + &amp;lt;jvm option for memory&amp;gt; to the native-image tool.The -XX:MaxRAMPercentage value determines the maximum heap size of the builder and is computed based on available memory of the system.It maxes out at 32GB by default and can be overwritten with, for example, -J-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=90.0 for 90% of physical memory or -Xmx4g for 4GB.-XX:GCTimeRatio=19 increases the goal of the total time for garbage collection to 5%, which is more throughput-oriented and reduces peak RSS.The build process also exits on the first OutOfMemoryError (-XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError) to provide faster feedback in environments under a lot of memory pressure.By default, the native-image tool uses up to 32 threads (but not more than the number of processors available). For custom values, use the --parallelism=... option.For other related options available to the native-image tool, see the output from the command native-image --expert-options-all.Specify Types Required to Be Defined at Build TimeA well-structured library or application should handle linking of Java types (ensuring all reachable Java types are fully defined at build time) when building a native binary by itself.The default behavior is to throw linking errors, if they occur, at runtime. However, you can prevent unwanted linking errors by specifying which classes are required to be fully linked at build time.For that, use the --link-at-build-time option. If the option is used in the right context (see below), you can specify required classes to link at build time without explicitly listing classes and packages.It is designed in a way that libraries can only configure their own classes, to avoid any side effects on other libraries.You can pass the option to the native-image tool on the command line, embed it in a native-image.properties file on the module-path or the classpath.Depending on how and where the option is used it behaves differently:  If you use --link-at-build-time without arguments, all classes in the scope are required to be fully defined. If used without arguments on command line, all classes will be treated as “link-at-build-time” classes. If used without arguments embedded in a native-image.properties file on the module-path, all classes of the module will be treated as “link-at-build-time” classes. If you use --link-at-build-time embedded in a native-image.properties file on the classpath, the following error will be thrown:      Error: Using &#39;--link-at-build-time&#39; without args only allowed on module-path. &#39;META-INF/native-image/org.mylibrary/native-image.properties&#39; in &#39;file:///home/test/myapp/MyLibrary.jar&#39; not part of module-path.    If you use the  --link-at-build-time option with arguments, for example, --link-at-build-time=foo.bar.Foobar,demo.myLibrary.Name,..., the arguments should be fully qualified class names or package names. When used on the module-path or classpath (embedded in native-image.properties files), only classes and packages defined in the same JAR file can be specified. Packages for libraries used on the classpath need to be listed explicitly. To make this process easy, use the @&amp;lt;prop-values-file&amp;gt; syntax to generate a package list (or a class list) in a separate file automatically.Another handy option is --link-at-build-time-paths which allows to specify which classes are required to be fully defined at build time by other means.This variant requires arguments that are of the same type as the arguments passed via -p (--module-path) or -cp (--class-path):--link-at-build-time-paths &amp;lt;class search path of directories and zip/jar files&amp;gt;The given entries are searched and all classes inside are registered as --link-at-build-time classes.This option is only allowed to be used on command line.Related Documentation  Class Initialization in Native Image  Native Image Basics  Native Image Build Options  Native Image Build Overview  Reachability Metadata",

It defaults to host’s OS-architecture pair.  --trace-class-initialization: provide a comma-separated list of fully-qualified class names that a class initialization is traced for  --trace-object-instantiation: provide a comma-separated list of fully-qualified class names that an object instantiation is traced for  -O&amp;lt;level&amp;gt;: control code optimizations where available variants are: b - optimize for fastest build time, 0 - no optimizations, 1 - basic optimizations, 2 - aggressive optimizations, 3 - all optimizations for best performance (enabled automatically with the Profile-guided optimization)  -da, -da[:[packagename]|:[classname], disableassertions[:[packagename]|:[classname]: disable assertions with specified granularity at run time  -dsa, -disablesystemassertions: disable assertions in all system classes at run time  -ea, -ea[:[packagename]|:[classname], enableassertions[:[packagename]|:[classname]: enable assertions with specified granularity at run time  -esa, -enablesystemassertions: enable assertions in all system classes at run time  -g: generate debugging information  -march: generate instructions for a specific machine type. Defaults to x86-64-v3 on AMD64 and armv8-a on AArch64. Use -march=compatibility for best compatibility, or -march=native for best performance if a native executable is deployed on the same machine or on a machine with the same CPU features. To list all available machine types, use -march=list.  -o: name of the output file to be generatedExtra Build OptionsRun native-image --help-extra for help on additional options.  --exclude-config: exclude configuration for a comma-separated pair of classpath/modulepath pattern and resource pattern. For example: --exclude-config foo.jar,META-INF/native-image/.*.properties ignores all properties files in META-INF/native-image in all JARs named foo.jar.  --expert-options: list image build options for experts  --expert-options-all: list all image build options for experts (use at your own risk). Options marked with Extra help available contain help that can be shown with --expert-options-detail  --expert-options-detail: display all available help for a comma-separated list of option names. Pass * to show extra help for all options that contain it.  --configurations-path &amp;lt;search path of option-configuration directories&amp;gt;: a separated list of directories to be treated as option-configuration directories.  --debug-attach[=&amp;lt;port or host:port (* can be used as host meaning bind to all interfaces)&amp;gt;]: attach to a debugger during native executable generation (default port is 8000)  --diagnostics-mode: Enables logging of image-build information to a diagnostics folder.  --dry-run: output the command line that would be used for building  --bundle-create[=new-bundle.nib]: in addition to image building, create a native image bundle file (*.nibfile) that allows rebuilding of that image again at a later point. If a bundle file gets passed, the bundle will be created with the given name. Otherwise, the bundle file name is derived from the image name. Note both bundle options can be extended with dry-run and container.          dry-run: only perform the bundle operations without any actual native executable building      container: set up a container image and perform a native executable generation from inside that container. Requires Podman or rootless Docker to be installed. If available, Podman is preferred and rootless Docker is the fallback. Specifying one or the other as =&amp;lt;container-tool&amp;gt; forces the use of a specific tool.      dockerfile=&amp;lt;Dockerfile&amp;gt;: use a user provided Dockerfile instead of the default based on Oracle Linux 8 base images for GraalVM        --bundle-apply=some-bundle.nib[,dry-run][,container[=&amp;lt;container-tool&amp;gt;][,dockerfile=&amp;lt;Dockerfile&amp;gt;]]: an image will be built from the given bundle file with the exact same arguments and files that have been passed to Native Image originally to create the bundle. Note that if an extra --bundle-create gets passed after --bundle-apply, a new bundle will be written based on the given bundle args plus any additional arguments that haven been passed afterwards. For example: native-image --bundle-apply=app.nib --bundle-create=app_dbg.nib -g creates a new bundle app_dbg.nib based on the given app.nib bundle. Both bundles are the same except the new one also uses the -g option.  -E&amp;lt;env-var-key&amp;gt;[=&amp;lt;env-var-value&amp;gt;]: allow Native Image to access the given environment variable during native executable generation. If the optional &amp;lt;env-var-value&amp;gt; is not given, the value of the environment variable will be taken from the environment Native Image was invoked from.  -V&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;:  provide values for placeholders in the native-image.properties files  --add-exports: value &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;package&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;target-module&amp;gt;(,&amp;lt;target-module&amp;gt;) updates &amp;lt;module&amp;gt; to export &amp;lt;package&amp;gt; to &amp;lt;target-module&amp;gt;, regardless of module declaration. &amp;lt;target-module&amp;gt; can be ALL-UNNAMED to export to all unnamed modules  --add-opens: value &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;package&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;target-module&amp;gt;(,&amp;lt;target-module&amp;gt;) updates &amp;lt;module&amp;gt; to open &amp;lt;package&amp;gt; to &amp;lt;target-module&amp;gt;, regardless of module declaration  --add-reads: value &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;target-module&amp;gt;(,&amp;lt;target-module&amp;gt;) updates &amp;lt;module&amp;gt; to read &amp;lt;target-module&amp;gt;, regardless of module declaration. &amp;lt;target-module&amp;gt; can be ALL-UNNAMED to read all unnamed modulesList of Useful OptionsThere are some expert level options that a user may find useful or needed. For example, the option to dump graphs of the native-image builder, or to print various statistics during the build process.Build Output and Build ReportNative Image provides an informative build output including various statistics during the build process.The build output in a JSON-based, machine-readable format can be requested using the -H:BuildOutputJSONFile option, and later processed by a monitoring tool.The JSON files validate against the JSON schema defined in build-output-schema-v0.9.2.json. A comprehensive report with additional information can be requested using the -H:+BuildReport option.  Note: The -H:+BuildReport option is not available in GraalVM Community Edition.Graph DumpingNative Image re-used the options for graph dumping, logging, counters, and everything else from the GraalVM debug environment.These GraalVM options can be used both as hosted options (if you want to dump graphs of the native-image builder), and as runtime options (if you want to dump graphs during dynamic compilation at runtime).The Graal compiler options that work as expected include Dump, DumpOnError, Log, MethodFilter, and the options to specify file names and ports for the dump handlers.For example:  -H:Dump= -H:MethodFilter=ClassName.MethodName: dump the compiler graphs of the native-image builder.  -XX:Dump= -XX:MethodFilter=ClassName.MethodName: dump the compile graphs at runtime.Related Documentation  Build Configuration  Build Overview",

The G1 GC (not available in GraalVM Community Edition) is a multi-threaded GC that is optimized to reduce stop-the-world pauses and therefore improve latency while achieving high throughput.  The Epsilon GC does not perform any garbage collection and is designed for very short-running applications that only allocate a small amount of memory.For more information see the docs on Memory Management.Maximum Heap SizeBy default, the heap size is limited to a certain percentage of your system memory, allowing the garbage collector to freely allocate memory according to its policy.Use the -Xmx option when invoking your native executable (for example ./myapp -Xmx64m for 64MB) to limit the maximum heap size for a lower and more predictable memory footprint.This can also improve latency in some cases.Use the -R:MaxHeapSize option when building with Native Image to pre-configure the maximum heap size.User-Specific FeaturesAll Features that are either provided or specifically enabled by the user, or implicitly registered for the user, for example, by a framework.GraalVM Native Image deploys a number of internal features, which are excluded from this list.Experimental OptionsA list of all active experimental options, including their origin and possible API option alternatives if available.Using experimental options should be avoided in production and can change in any release.If you rely on experimental features and would like an option to be considered stable, please file an issue.Picked up NATIVE_IMAGE_OPTIONSAdditional build options picked up via the NATIVE_IMAGE_OPTIONS environment variable.Similar to JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS, the value of the environment variable is prepended to the options supplied to native-image.Argument files are not allowed to be passed via NATIVE_IMAGE_OPTIONS.The NATIVE_IMAGE_OPTIONS environment variable is designed to be used by users, build environments, or tools to inject additional build options.Build ResourcesThe memory limit and number of threads used by the build process.More precisely, the memory limit of the Java heap, so actual memory consumption can be even higher.Please check the peak RSS reported at the end of the build to understand how much memory was actually used.By default, the build process tries to only use free memory (to avoid memory pressure on the build machine), and never more than 32GB of memory.If less than 8GB of memory are free, the build process falls back to use 85% of total memory.Therefore, consider freeing up memory if your machine is slow during a build, for example, by closing applications that you do not need.It is possible to overwrite the default behavior, for example with -J-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=60.0 or -J-Xmx16g.By default, the build process uses all available processors to maximize speed, but not more than 32 threads.Use the --parallelism option to set the number of threads explicitly (for example, --parallelism=4).Use fewer threads to reduce load on your system as well as memory consumption (at the cost of a slower build process).Performing AnalysisIn this stage, a points-to analysis is performed.The progress indicator visualizes the number of analysis iterations.A large number of iterations can indicate problems in the analysis likely caused by misconfiguration or a misbehaving feature.Reachable Types, Fields, and MethodsThe number of types (primitives, classes, interfaces, and arrays), fields, and methods that are reachable versus the total number of types, fields, and methods loaded as part of the build process.A significantly larger number of loaded elements that are not reachable can indicate a configuration problem.To reduce overhead, please ensure that your class path and module path only contain entries that are needed for building the application.Reflection RegistrationsThe number of types, fields, and methods that are registered for reflection.Large numbers can cause significant reflection overheads, slow down the build process, and increase the size of the native binary (see reflection metadata).JNI Access RegistrationsThe number of types, fields, and methods that are registered for JNI access.Foreign functions stubsThe number of downcalls registered for foreign function access.Runtime Compiled MethodsThe number of methods marked for runtime compilation.This number is only shown if runtime compilation is built into the executable, for example, when building a Truffle language.Runtime-compiled methods account for graph encodings in the heap.Building UniverseIn this stage, a universe with all types, fields, and methods is built, which is then used to create the native binary.Parsing MethodsIn this stage, the Graal compiler parses all reachable methods.The progress indicator is printed periodically at an increasing interval.Inlining MethodsIn this stage, trivial method inlining is performed.The progress indicator visualizes the number of inlining iterations.Compiling MethodsIn this stage, the Graal compiler compiles all reachable methods to machine code.The progress indicator is printed periodically at an increasing interval.Layouting MethodsIn this stage, compiled methods are layouted.The progress indicator is printed periodically at an increasing interval.Creating ImageIn this stage, the native binary is created and written to disk.Debug info is also generated as part of this stage (if requested).Code AreaThe code area contains machine code produced by the Graal compiler for all reachable methods.Therefore, reducing the number of reachable methods also reduces the size of the code area.Origins of Code AreaTo help users understand where the machine code of the code area comes from, the build output shows a breakdown of the top origins.An origin is a group of Java sources and can be a JAR file, a package name, or a class name, depending on the information available.The java.base module, for example, contains base classes from the JDK.The svm.jar file, the org.graalvm.nativeimage.base module, and similar origins contain internal sources for the Native Image runtime.To reduce the size of the code area and with that, the total size of the native executable, re-evaluate the dependencies of your application based on the code area breakdown.Some libraries and frameworks are better prepared for Native Image than others, and newer versions of a library or framework may improve (or worsen) their code footprint.Image HeapThe heap contains reachable objects such as static application data, metadata, and byte[] for different purposes (see below).General Heap Data Stored in byte[]The total size of all byte[] objects that are neither used for java.lang.String, nor code metadata, nor reflection metadata, nor graph encodings.Therefore, this can also include byte[] objects from application code.Embedded Resources Stored in byte[]The total size of all byte[] objects used for storing resources (for example, files accessed via Class.getResource()) within the native binary.The number of resources is shown in the Heap section.Code Metadata Stored in byte[]The total size of all byte[] objects used for metadata for the code area.Therefore, reducing the number of reachable methods also reduces the size of this metadata.Reflection Metadata Stored in byte[]The total size of all byte[] objects used for reflection metadata, including types, field, method, and constructor data.To reduce the amount of reflection metadata, reduce the number of elements registered for reflection.Graph Encodings Stored in byte[]The total size of all byte[] objects used for graph encodings.These encodings are a result of runtime compiled methods.Therefore, reducing the number of such methods also reduces the size of corresponding graph encodings.Heap AlignmentAdditional space reserved to align the heap for the selected garbage collector.The heap alignment may also contain GC-specific data structures.Its size can therefore only be influenced by switching to a different garbage collector.Debug InfoThe total size of generated debug information (if enabled).Other DataThe amount of data in the binary that is neither in the code area, nor in the heap, nor debug info.This data typically contains internal information for Native Image and should not be dominating.Security ReportThis section is not available in GraalVM Community Edition.DeserializationThis shows whether Java deserialization is included in the native executable or not.If not included, the attack surface of the executable is reduced as the executable cannot be exploited with attacks based on Java deserialization.Embedded SBOMNumber of components and the size of the embedded Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).Use --enable-sbom to include an SBOM in the native executable.For more information, see Inspection ToolBackwards-Edge Control-Flow Integrity (CFI)Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) can be enforced with the experimental -H:CFI=HW option.This feature is currently only available for Linux AArch64 and leverages pointer authentication codes (PAC) to ensure integrity of a function’s return address.Software Control-Flow Integrity (CFI)Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) can be enforced in software with the experimental -H:CFI=SW_NONATIVE or -H:CFI=SW option.This feature is currently only available for Linux AMD64 and validates targets of indirect branches and method returns.RecommendationsThe build output may contain one or more of the following recommendations that help you get the best out of Native Image.INIT: Use the Strict Image Heap ConfigurationStart using --strict-image-heap to reduce the amount of configuration and prepare for future GraalVM releases where this will be the default.This mode requires only the classes that are stored in the image heap to be marked with --initialize-at-build-time. This effectively reduces the number of configuration entries necessary to achieve build-time initialization. When adopting the new mode it is best to start introducing build-time initialization from scratch.During this process, it is best to select individual classes (as opposed to whole packages) for build time initialization.Also, before migrating to the new flag make sure to update all framework dependencies to the latest versions as they might need to migrate too.AWT: Missing Reachability Metadata for Abstract Window ToolkitThe Native Image analysis has included classes from the java.awt package but could not find any reachability metadata for it.Use the tracing agent to collect such metadata for your application.Otherwise, your application is unlikely to work properly.If your application is not a desktop application (for example using Swing or AWT directly), you may want to re-evaluate whether the dependency on AWT is actually needed.CPU: Enable More CPU Features for Improved PerformanceThe Native Image build process has determined that your CPU supports more features, such as AES or LSE, than currently enabled.If you deploy your application on the same machine or a similar machine with support for the same CPU features, consider using -march=native at build time.This option allows the Graal compiler to use all CPU features available, which in turn can significantly improve the performance of your application.Use -march=list to list all available machine types that can be targeted explicitly.G1GC: Use G1 Garbage Collector for Improved Latency and ThroughputThe G1 garbage collector is available for your platform.Consider enabling it using --gc=G1 at build time to improve the latency and throughput of your application.For more information see the docs on Memory Management.For best peak performance, also consider using Profile-Guided Optimizations.HEAP: Specify a Maximum Heap SizePlease refer to Maximum Heap Size.PGO: Use Profile-Guided Optimizations for Improved ThroughputConsider using Profile-Guided Optimizations to optimize your application for improved throughput.These optimizations allow the Graal compiler to leverage profiling information, similar to when it is running as a JIT compiler, when AOT-compiling your application.For this, perform the following steps:  Build your application with --pgo-instrument.  Run your instrumented application with a representative workload to generate profiling information in the form of an .iprof file.  Re-build your application and pass in the profiling information with --pgo=&amp;lt;your&amp;gt;.iprof to generate an optimized version of your application.Relevant guide: Optimize a Native Executable with Profile-Guided Optimizations.For best peak performance, also consider using the G1 garbage collector.QBM: Use Quick Build Mode for Faster BuildsConsider using the quick build mode (-Ob) to speed up your builds during development.More precisely, this mode reduces the number of optimizations performed by the Graal compiler and thus reduces the overall time of the compilation stage.The quick build mode is not only useful for development, it can also cause the generated executable file to be smaller in size.Note, however, that the overall peak throughput of the executable may be lower due to the reduced number of optimizations.Resource Usage StatisticsGarbage CollectionsThe total time spent in all garbage collectors, total GC time divided by the total process time as a percentage, and the total number of garbage collections.A large number of collections or time spent in collectors usually indicates that the system is under memory pressure.Increase the amount of available memory to reduce the time to build the native binary.Peak RSSPeak resident set size as reported by the operating system.This value indicates the maximum amount of memory consumed by the build process.You may want to compare this value to the memory limit reported in the build resources section.If there is enough headroom and the GC statistics do not show any problems, the amount of total memory of the system can be reduced to a value closer to the peak RSS to lower operational costs.CPU loadThe CPU time used by the process divided by the total process time.Increase the number of CPU cores to reduce the time to build the native binary.Machine-Readable Build OutputThe build output produced by the native-image builder is designed for humans, can evolve with new releases, and should thus not be parsed in any way by tools.Instead, use the -H:BuildOutputJSONFile=&amp;lt;file.json&amp;gt; option to instruct the builder to produce machine-readable build output in JSON format that can be used, for example, for building monitoring tools.The JSON files validate against the JSON schema defined in build-output-schema-v0.9.2.json.Note that a JSON file is produced if and only if a build succeeds.The following example illustrates how this could be used in a CI/CD build pipeline to check that the number of reachable methods does not exceed a certain threshold:native-image -H:BuildOutputJSONFile=build.json HelloWorld# ...cat build.json | python3 -c &quot;import json,sys;c = json.load(sys.stdin)[&#39;analysis_results&#39;][&#39;methods&#39;][&#39;reachable&#39;]; assert c &amp;lt; 12000, f&#39;Too many reachable methods: {c}&#39;&quot;Traceback (most recent call last):  File &quot;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&quot;, line 1, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;AssertionError: Too many reachable methods: 12128Colorful Build OutputBy default, the native-image builder colors the build output for better readability when it finds an appropriate terminal.It also honors the NO_COLOR, CI, and TERM environment variables when checking for color support.To explicitly control colorful output, set the --color option to always, never, or auto (default).Related Documentation  Build a Native Shared Library  Build a Statically Linked or Mostly-Statically Linked Native Executable  Feature  Interoperability with Native Code  Java Native Interface (JNI) in Native Image  Memory Management  Native Image Build Overview  Native Image Build Configuration",

In contrast to regular native-image building, this mode of operation takes only a single *.nib file as input.The file contains everything required to build a native executable (or a native shared library).This can be useful when large applications consisting of many input files (JAR files, configuration files, auto-generated files, downloaded files) need to be rebuilt at a later point in time without worrying whether all files are still available.Often complex builds involve downloading many libraries that are not guaranteed to remain accessible later in time.Using Native Image bundles is a safe solution to encapsulate all this input required for building into a single file.  Note: The feature is experimental.Table of Contents  Creating Bundles  Building with Bundles  Environment Variables  Creating New Bundles from Existing Bundles  Executing the bundled application  Bundle File FormatCreating BundlesTo create a bundle, pass the --bundle-create option along with the other arguments for a specific native-image command line invocation.This will cause native-image to create a *.nib file in addition to the actual image.Here is the option description:--bundle-create[=new-bundle.nib][,dry-run][,container[=&amp;lt;container-tool&amp;gt;][,dockerfile=&amp;lt;Dockerfile&amp;gt;]]                      in addition to image building, create a Native Image bundle file (*.nib                      file) that allows rebuilding of that image again at a later point. If a                      bundle-file gets passed, the bundle will be created with the given                      name. Otherwise, the bundle-file name is derived from the image name.                      Note both bundle options can be extended with &quot;,dry-run&quot; and &quot;,container&quot;                      * &#39;dry-run&#39;: only perform the bundle operations without any actual image building.                      * &#39;container&#39;: sets up a container image for image building and performs image building                        from inside that container.

Having the image inside the bundle allows comparing a native executable rebuilt from the bundle against the original one.In the case of the micronaut-data-jdbc-repository example, the bundle is 60.7 MB (the executable is 103.4 MB).To see what is inside a bundle, run jar tf *.nib:$ jar tf micronautguide.nibMETA-INF/MANIFEST.MFMETA-INF/nibundle.propertiesoutput/default/micronautguidecom/oracle/svm/driver/launcher/BundleLauncherUtil.classcom/oracle/svm/driver/launcher/ContainerSupport$TargetPath.classcom/oracle/svm/driver/launcher/BundleLauncherHelp.txtcom/oracle/svm/driver/launcher/BundleLauncher.classcom/oracle/svm/driver/launcher/configuration/BundleConfigurationParser.classcom/oracle/svm/driver/launcher/configuration/BundleEnvironmentParser.classcom/oracle/svm/driver/launcher/configuration/BundleArgsParser.classcom/oracle/svm/driver/launcher/configuration/BundlePathMapParser.classcom/oracle/svm/driver/launcher/configuration/BundleContainerSettingsParser.classcom/oracle/svm/driver/launcher/ContainerSupport.classcom/oracle/svm/driver/launcher/json/BundleJSONParser.classcom/oracle/svm/driver/launcher/json/BundleJSONParserException.classinput/classes/cp/micronaut-core-3.8.7.jarinput/classes/cp/netty-buffer-4.1.87.Final.jarinput/classes/cp/jackson-databind-2.14.1.jarinput/classes/cp/micronaut-context-3.8.7.jarinput/classes/cp/reactive-streams-1.0.4.jar...input/classes/cp/netty-handler-4.1.87.Final.jarinput/classes/cp/micronaut-jdbc-4.7.2.jarinput/classes/cp/jackson-core-2.14.0.jarinput/classes/cp/micronaut-runtime-3.8.7.jarinput/classes/cp/micronautguide-0.1.jarinput/stage/path_substitutions.jsoninput/stage/path_canonicalizations.jsoninput/stage/build.jsoninput/stage/run.jsoninput/stage/environment.jsoninput/stage/DockerfileAs you can see, a bundle is just a JAR file with a specific layout.This is explained in detail below.Next to the bundle, you can also find the output directory: target/micronautguide.output.It contains the native executable and all other files that were created as part of the build.

Note that if an extra --bundle-create gets passed                      after --bundle-apply, a new bundle will be written based on the given                      bundle args plus any additional arguments that have been passed                      afterwards. For example:                      &amp;gt; native-image --bundle-apply=app.nib --bundle-create=app_dbg.nib -g                      creates a new bundle app_dbg.nib based on the given app.nib bundle.                      Both bundles are the same except the new one also uses the -g option.Building in a ContainerAnother addition to the --bundle-create and --bundle-apply options, as mentioned above, is to perform image building inside a container image.This ensures that during the image build native-image can not access any resources that were not explicitly specified via the classpath or module path.Modify the --bundle-create argument in the native-maven-plugin configuration to &amp;lt;buildArg&amp;gt;--bundle-create,container&amp;lt;buildArg&amp;gt;.This still creates the same bundle as before. However, a container image is built and then used for building the native image executable.If the container image is newly created, you can also see the build output from the container tool. The name of the container image is the hash of the used Dockerfile.If the container image already exists you will see the following line in the build output instead:Native Image Bundles: Reusing container image c253ca50f50b380da0e23b168349271976d57e4e.For building in a container you require either podman or rootless docker to be available on your system.Additionally, building in a container is currently only supported for Linux.Using any other OS native image will not create and use a container image.The container tool used for running the image build can be specified with &amp;lt;buildArg&amp;gt;--bundle-create,container=podman&amp;lt;buildArg&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;buildArg&amp;gt;--bundle-create,container=docker&amp;lt;buildArg&amp;gt;.If not specified, native-image uses one of the supported tools. If available, podman is preferred and rootless docker is the fallback.The Dockerfile used to build the container image may also be explicitly specified with --bundle-create,container,dockerfile=&amp;lt;path-to-dockerfile&amp;gt;.If no Dockerfile was specified, a default Dockerfile is used, which is based on the Oracle Linux 8 container images for GraalVM from here.Whichever Dockerfile is finally used to build the container image is stored in the bundle.Even if you do not use the container option, native-image creates a Dockerfile and stores it in the bundle.Other than creating a container image on the host system, building inside a container does not create any additional build output.However, the created bundle contains some additional files:$ jar tf micronautguide.nibMETA-INF/MANIFEST.MFMETA-INF/nibundle.properties...input/classes/cp/micronaut-management-3.8.7.jarinput/stage/path_substitutions.jsoninput/stage/path_canonicalizations.jsoninput/stage/build.jsoninput/stage/run.jsoninput/stage/environment.jsoninput/stage/Dockerfileinput/stage/container.jsonThe bundle contains the Dockerfile used for building the container image and stores the used container tool, its version and the name of the container image in container.json:{    &quot;containerTool&quot;:&quot;podman&quot;,    &quot;containerToolVersion&quot;:&quot;podman version 3.4.4&quot;,    &quot;containerImage&quot;:&quot;c253ca50f50b380da0e23b168349271976d57e4e&quot;}The container option may also be combined with dry-run, in this case native-image does neither create an executable nor a container image.It does not even check if the selected container tool is available.In this case, container.json is omitted, or, if you explicitly specified a container tool, just contains the containerTool field without any additional information.Containerized builds are sticky, which means that if a bundle was created with --bundle-create,container the bundle is marked as a container build.If you now use --bundle-apply with this bundle, it is automatically built in a container again.However, this does not apply to executing a bundle, a bundled application is still executed outside a container by default.The extended command line interface for containerized builds is shown in the option help texts for --bundle-create and --bundle-apply above.Capturing Environment VariablesBefore bundle support was added, all environment variables were visible to the  native-image builder.This approach does not work well with bundles and is problematic for image building without bundles.Consider having an environment variable that holds sensitive information from your build machine.Due to Native Image’s ability to run code at build time that can create data to be available at run time, it is very easy to build an image where you accidentally leak the contents of such variables.Passing environment variables to native-image now requires explicit arguments.Suppose a user wants to use an environment variable (for example, KEY_STORAGE_PATH) from the environment in which the native-image tool is invoked, in the class initializer that is set to be initialized at build time.To allow accessing the variable in the class initializer (with java.lang.System.getenv), pass the option -EKEY_STORAGE_PATH to the builder.To make an environment variable accessible to build time, use:-E&amp;lt;env-var-key&amp;gt;[=&amp;lt;env-var-value&amp;gt;]                      allow native-image to access the given environment variable during                      image build. If the optional &amp;lt;env-var-value&amp;gt; is not given, the value                      of the environment variable will be taken from the environment                      native-image was invoked from.Using -E works as expected with bundles.Any environment variable specified with -E will be captured in the bundle.For variables where the optional &amp;lt;env-var-value&amp;gt; is not given, the bundle would capture the value the variable had at the time the bundle was created.The prefix -E was chosen to make the option look similar to the related -D&amp;lt;java-system-property-key&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;java-system-property-value&amp;gt; option (which makes Java system properties available at build time).Combining –bundle-create and –bundle-applyAs already mentioned in Building with Bundles, it is possible to create a new bundle based on an existing one.The --bundle-apply help message has a simple example.A more interesting example arises if an existing bundle is used to create a new bundle that builds a PGO-optimized version of the original application.Assuming you have already built the micronaut-data-jdbc-repository example into a bundle named micronautguide.nib.To produce a PGO-optimized variant of that bundle, first build a variant of the native executable that generates PGO profiling information at run time (you will use it later):$ native-image --bundle-apply=micronautguide.nib --pgo-instrumentNow run the generated executable so that profile information is collected:$ /home/testuser/micronautguide.output/default/micronautguideBased on this walkthrough, you use the running native executable to add new database entries and query the information in the database afterwards so that you get real-world profiling information.Once completed, stop the Micronaut application using Ctrl+C (SIGTERM).Looking into the current working directory, you can find a new file:$ ls -lh  *.iprof-rw------- 1 testuser testuser 19M Mar 28 14:52 default.iprofThe file default.iprof contains the profiling information that was created because you ran the Micronaut application from the executable built with --pgo-instrument.Now you can create a new optimized bundle out of the existing one:native-image --bundle-apply=micronautguide.nib --bundle-create=micronautguide-pgo-optimized.nib,dry-run --pgoNow take a look how micronautguide-pgo-optimized.nib is different from micronautguide.nib:$ ls -lh *.nib-rw-r--r-- 1 testuser testuser  20M Mar 28 11:12 micronautguide.nib-rw-r--r-- 1 testuser testuser  23M Mar 28 15:02 micronautguide-pgo-optimized.nibYou can see that the new bundle is 3 MB larger than the original.The reason, as can be guessed, is that now the bundle contains the default.iprof file.Using a tool to compare directories, you can inspect the differences in detail:As you can see, micronautguide-pgo-optimized.nib contains default.iprof in the directory input/auxiliary, and thereare also changes in other files. The contents of META-INF/nibundle.properties, input/stage/path_substitutions.jsonand input/stage/path_canonicalizations.json will be explained later.

The file input/stage/build.json holds the original command line that was passed to native-image when the bundle was created.Parameters that make no sense to get reapplied in a bundle-build are already filtered out.These include:  --bundle-{create,apply}  --verbose  --dry-runThe state of environment variables that are relevant for the build are captured in input/stage/environment.json.For every -E argument that was seen when the bundle was created, a snapshot of its key-value pair is recorded in the file.The remaining files path_canonicalizations.json and path_substitutions.json contain a record of the file-path transformations that were performed by the native-image tool based on the input file paths as specified by the original command line arguments.outputIf a native executable is built as part of building the bundle (for example, the ,dry-run option was not used), you also have an output directory in the bundle.It contains the executable that was built along with any other files that were generated as part of building.Most output files are located in the directory output/default (the executable, its debug info, and debug sources).Builder output files, that would have been written to arbitrary absolute paths if the executable had not been built in the bundle mode, can be found in output/other.Related Documentation  Native Image Build Configuration  Native Image Build Output",

          "content": "Certificate Management in Native ImageNative Image provides multiple ways to specify the certificate file used to define the default TrustStore.In the following sections we describe the available build-time and run-time options.Note: The default behavior for native-image is to capture and use the default TrustStore from the build-time host environment.Build-time OptionsDuring the image building process, the native-image builder captures the host environment’s default TrustStore and embeds it into the native executable.This TrustStore is by default created from the root certificate file provided within the JDK, but can be changed to use a different certificate file by setting the build-time system property javax.net.ssl.trustStore (see Properties for how to do it).Since the contents of the build-time certificate file is embedded into the native executable, the file itself does not need to be present in the target environment.Runtime OptionsThe certificate file can also be changed dynamically at run time via setting the javax.net.ssl.trustStore* system properties.If any of the following system properties are set during the image execution, native-image also requires javax.net.ssl.trustStore to be set, and for it to point to an accessible certificate file:  javax.net.ssl.trustStore  javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType  javax.net.ssl.trustStoreProvider  javax.net.ssl.trustStorePasswordIf any of these properties are set and javax.net.ssl.trustStore does not point to an accessible file, then an UnsupportedFeatureError will be thrown.Note that this behavior is different than OpenJDK.When the javax.net.ssl.trustStore system property is unset or invalid, OpenJDK will fallback to using a certificate file shipped within the JDK.However, such files will not be present alongside the image executable and hence cannot be used as a fallback.During the execution, it also possible to dynamically change the javax.net.ssl.trustStore* properties and for the default TrustStore to be updated accordingly.Finally, whenever all of the javax.net.ssl.trustStore* system properties listed above are unset, the default TrustStore will be the one captured during the build time, as described in the prior section.Untrusted CertificatesDuring the image building process, a list of untrusted certificates is loaded from the file &amp;lt;java.home&amp;gt;/lib/security/blacklisted.certs.This file is used when validating certificates at both build time and run time.In other words, when a new certificate file is specified at run time via setting the javax.net.ssl.trustStore* system properties, the new certificates will still be checked against the &amp;lt;java.home&amp;gt;/lib/security/blacklisted.certs loaded atimage build time.Further Reading  Native Image Build Configuration",

          "title": "Class Initialization in Native Image",
          "content": "Class Initialization in Native ImageThe semantics of Java requires that a class is initialized the first time it is accessed at runtime.Class initialization has negative consequences for compiling Java applications ahead-of-time for the following two reasons:  It significantly degrades the performance of a native executable: every access to a class (via a field or method) requires a check to ensure the class is already initialized. Without optimization, this can reduce performance by more than twofold.  It increases the amount of computation–and time–to startup an application. For example, the simple “Hello, World!” application requires more than 300 classes to be initialized.To reduce the negative impact of class initialization, Native Image supports class initialization at build time: it can initialize classes when it builds an executable, making runtime initialization and checks unnecessary.All the static state from initialized classes is stored in the executable.Access to a class’s static fields that were initialized at build time is transparent to the application and works as if the class was initialized at runtime.However, Java class initialization semantics impose several constraints that complicate class initialization policies, such as:      When a class is initialized, all its superclasses and superinterfaces with default methods must also be initialized.Interfaces without default methods, however, are not initialized.To accommodate this requirement, a short-term “relevant supertype” is used, as well as a “relevant subtype” for subtypes of classes and interfaces with default methods.    Relevant supertypes of types initialized at build time must also be initialized at build time.  Relevant subtypes of types initialized at runtime must also be initialized at runtime.  No instances of classes that are initialized at runtime must be present in the executable.To enjoy the complete out-of-the-box experience of Native Image and still get the benefits of build-time initialization, Native Image does two things:  Build-Time Initialization  Automatic Initialization of Safe ClassesTo track which classes were initialized and why, pass the command-line option -H:+PrintClassInitialization to the native-image tool.This option helps you configure the native image builder to work as required.The goal is to have as many classes as possible initialized at build time, yet keep the correct semantics of the application.Build-Time InitializationNative Image initializes most JDK classes at build time, including the garbage collector, important JDK classes, and the deoptimizer.For all of the classes that are initialized at build time, Native Image gives proper support so that the semantics remain consistent despite class initialization occurring at build time.If you discover an issue with a JDK class behaving incorrectly because of class initialization at build time, please report an issue.Automatic Initialization of Safe ClassesFor application classes, Native Image tries to find classes that can be safely initialized at build time.A class is considered safe if all of its relevant supertypes are safe and if the class initializer does not call any unsafe methods or initialize other unsafe classes.A method is considered unsafe if:  It transitively calls into native code (such as System.out.println): native code is not analyzed so Native Image cannot know if illegal actions are performed.  It calls a method that cannot be reduced to a single target (a virtual method).This restriction avoids the explosion of search space for the safety analysis of static initializers.  It is substituted by Native Image. Running initializers of substituted methods would yield different results in the hosting Java virtual machine (VM) than in the produced executable.As a result, the safety analysis would consider some methods safe but calling them would lead to illegal states.A test that shows examples of classes that are proven safe can be found here.The list of all classes that are proven safe is output to a file via the -H:+PrintClassInitialization command-line option to the native-image tool.

Note that the rules are open for discussion!Source Code FormattingThe IDE projects generated with mx ideinit are configured with strict formatting rules.In Eclipse, when a file is saved, it is automatically formatted according to these rules.The configuration includes special comments which can be used to relax checks in particular regions of code.Source code formatting can be disabled with special comments://@formatter:off//@formatter:onComment reformatting can be disabled like this:/*- * */Checks with CheckstyleCheckstyle is used to verify adherence to the style rules.It can be run manually with mx checkstyle.The default Checkstyle rules are defined in src/com.oracle.svm.core/.checkstyle_checks.xml and define various special comments, including//Checkstyle: stop method name check//Checkstyle: resume method name checkand similar commands for other checks that can be disabled (including general stop and resume commands).Of course, ensuring a reasonable use of these comments is a matter for code review.If a project requires a different set of Checkstyle rules, this can be specified in mx.substratevm/suite.py by changing the value of the project’s checkstyle attribute (which, by default, references com.oracle.svm.core).Specific code files can be excluded from checkstyle on a directory granularity with a file src/&amp;lt;project name&amp;gt;/.checkstyle.exclude.Such an exclusion file must contain one directory per line, with paths relative to the project root.The file must be explicitly added with git add because git will ignore it by default.When pulling a changeset which adds or removes Checkstyle XML files, the IDE might show inappropriate style warnings or errors.This is resolved by running mx ideinit and cleaning the affected projects.IDE IntegrationIDE plugins can be helpful in adhering to style rules.Some examples are:  Eclipse Checkstyle Plugin: reports Checkstyle violations in Eclipse, making it unnecessary to run mx checkstyle manually.

          "title": "Native Image Compatibility Guide",
          "content": "Native Image Compatibility GuideNative Image uses a different way of compiling a Java application than the traditional Java virtual machine (VM).It distinguishes between build time and run time.At the image build time, the native-image builder performs static analysis to find all the methods that are reachable from the entry point of an application.The builder then compiles these (and only these) methods into an executable binary.Because of this different compilation model, a Java application can behave somewhat differently when compiled into a native image.Native Image provides an optimization to reduce the memory footprint and startup time of an application.This approach relies on a “closed-world assumption” in which all code is known at build time. That is, no new code is loaded at run time.As with most optimizations, not all applications are amenable to this approach.If the native-image builder is unable to optimize an application at build time, it generates a so-called “fallback file” that requires a Java VM to run.We recommend to check Native Image Basics for a detailed description what happens with your Java application at build and run times.Features Requiring MetadataTo be suitable for closed-world assumption, the following Java features generally require metadata to pass to native-image at build time. This metadata ensures that a native image uses the minimum amount of space necessary.The compatibility of Native Image with the most popular Java libraries was recently enhanced by publishing shared reachability metadata on GitHub. The users can share the burden of maintaining metadata for third-party dependencies and reuse it.See Reachability Metadata to learn more.Features Incompatible with Closed-World AssumptionSome Java features are not yet supported within the closed-world assumption, and if used, result in a fallback file.invokedynamic Bytecode and Method HandlesUnder the closed-world assumption, all methods that are called and their call sites must be known.The invokedynamicmethod and method handles can introduce calls at run time or change the method that is invoked.Note that invokedynamic use cases generated by javac for, for example, Java lambda expressions and String concatenation that are supported because they do not change called methods at run time.Features That May Operate Differently in a Native ImageNative Image implements some Java features differently to the Java VM.Security Managerjava.lang.System#getSecurityManager() always returns null even if the security manager is set via -Djava.security.manager at startup.java.lang.System#setSecurityManager(SecurityManager) invoked with a non-null argument throws a java.lang.SecurityException if -Djava.security.manager is set to anything but disallow at program startup.Signal HandlersRegistering a signal handler requires a new thread to start that handles the signal and invokes shutdown hooks.By default, no signal handlers are registered when building a native image, unless they are registered explicitly by the user.For example, it is not recommended to register the default signal handlers when building a shared library, but it is desirable to include signal handlers when building a native executable for containerized environments, such as Docker containers.To register the default signal handlers, pass the --install-exit-handlers option to the native-image builder.This option gives you the same signal handlers as a Java VM.Class InitializersBy default, classes are initialized at run time.This ensures compatibility, but limits some optimizations.For faster startup and better peak performance, it is better to initialize classes at build time.Class initialization behavior can be specified using the options --initialize-at-build-time or --initialize-at-run-time for specific classes and packages or for all classes.Classes that are members of the JDK class libraries are initialized by default.Note: Class initialization at build time may break specific assumptions in existing code.For example, files loaded in a class initializer may not be in the same place at build time as at run time.Also, certain objects such as a file descriptors or running threads must not be stored in a native executable.If such objects are reachable at build time, the native image builder fails with an error.For more information, see Class Initialization in Native Image.FinalizersThe Java base class java.lang.Object defines the method finalize().It is called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection determines that there are no more references to the object.A subclass can override the finalize() method to dispose of system resources or to perform other cleanup operations.Finalizers have been deprecated since Java SE 9.They are complicated to implement, and have badly designed semantics.For example, a finalizer can cause an object to be reachable again by storing a reference to it in a static field.Therefore, finalizers are not invoked.We recommend you replace finalizers with weak references and reference queues.ThreadsNative Image does not implement long-deprecated methods in java.lang.Thread such as Thread.stop().Unsafe Memory AccessFields that are accessed using sun.misc.Unsafe need to be marked as such for the static analysis if classes are initialized at build time.In most cases, that happens automatically: field offsets stored in static final fields are automatically rewritten from the hosted value (the field offset for the Java VM on which the native image builder is running) to the native executable value, and as part of that rewrite the field is marked as Unsafe-accessed.For non-standard patterns, field offsets can be recomputed manually using the annotation RecomputeFieldValue.Debugging and MonitoringJava has some optional specifications that a Java implementation can use for debugging and monitoring Java programs, including JVMTI.They help you monitor the Java VM at runtime for events such as compilation, for example, which do not occur in most native images.These interfaces are built on the assumption that Java bytecodes are available at run time, which is not the case for native images built with the closed-world optimization.Because the native-image builder generates a native executable, users must use native debuggers and monitoring tools (such as GDB or VTune) rather than tools targeted for Java.JVMTI and other bytecode-based tools are not supported with Native Image.Limitations on Linux AArch64 ArchitectureMostly all Native Image features are supported on Linux AArch64 architecture, except for the limitations described below.  -R:[+|-]WriteableCodeCache: must be disabled.  --libc=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;: musl is

          "content": "GraalVM R Runtime CompatibilityThe GraalVM R runtime is based on GNU R and reuses the base packages.It is currently based on GNU R 4.0.3, and moves to new major versions of R as they become available and stable.GraalVM’s R runtime developers maintain an extensive set of unit tests for all aspects of the R language and the builtin functionality, and these tests are available as part of the R source code.GraalVM’s R runtime aims to be fully compatible with GNU R, including its native interface as used by R extensions.It can install and run unmodified, complex R packages like ggplot2, Shiny, or Rcpp.As some packages rely on unspecified behaviour or implementation details of GNU R, support for packages is a work in progress, and some packages might not install successfully or work as expected.Installing PackagesPackages can be installed using the install.packages function or the R CMD INSTALL shell command.By default, GraalVM’s R runtime uses a fixed snapshot of the CRAN repository1.This behavior can be overridden by explicitly setting the repos argument of the install.packages function.This functionality does not interfere with the checkpoint package. If you are behind a proxy server, make sure to configure the proxy either with environment variables or using the JVM options, e.g., --vm.Djava.net.useSystemProxies=true.The versions of some packages specifically patched for GraalVM’s R runtime can be installed using the install.fastr.packages function that downloads them from the GitHub repository.Currently, those are rJava and data.table.LimitationsThere are some limitations of the GraalVM R runtime compared to GNU R:  Only small parts of the low-level graphics package are functional. However, the grid package is supported and R can install and run packages based on it, like ggplot2. Support for the graphics package in R is planned for future releases.  Encoding of character vectors: related builtins (e.g., Encoding) are available,   but do not execute any useful code. Character vectors are represented as Java Strings and therefore encoded in the UTF-16 format. GraalVM’s R runtime will add support for encoding in future releases.  Some parts of the native API (e.g., DATAPTR) expose implementation details that are hard to emulate for alternative implementations of R. These are implemented as needed while testing the GraalVM R runtime with various CRAN packages.1 More technically, GraalVM’s R runtime uses a fixed MRAN URL from $R_HOME/etc/DEFAULT_CRAN_MIRROR, which is a snapshot of the CRAN repository as it was visible at a given date from the URL string.",

          "content": "Compiling to LLVM BitcodeGraalVM can execute C/C++, Rust, and other languages that can be compiled to LLVM bitcode.As the first step, you have to compile a program to LLVM bitcode using some LLVM compiler front end, for example, clang for C and C++, rust for the Rust programing language, etc.File FormatWhile the GraalVM LLVM runtime can execute plain bitcode files, the preferred format is a native executable with embedded bitcode.The executable file formats differ on Linux and macOS.Linux by default uses ELF files.The bitcode is stored in a section called .llvmbc.The macOS platform uses Mach-O files.The bitcode is in the __bundle section of the __LLVM segment.Using native executables with embedded bitcode offers two advantages over plain bitcode files.First, build systems for native projects, for example a Makefile, expect the result to be an executable.Embedding the bitcode instead of changing the output format improves compatibility with existing projects.Second, executables allow specifying library dependencies which is not possible with LLVM bitcode.The GraalVM LLVM runtime utilizes this information to find and load dependencies.LLVM Toolchain for Compiling C/C++To simplify compiling C/C++ to executables with embedded bitcode, the LLVM runtime comes with a prebuilt LLVM toolchain.The toolchain contains compilers such as clang for C or clang++ for C++, but also other tools that are neededfor building native projects such as a linker (ld), or an archiver (ar) for creating static libraries.  Get the location of the toolchain, using the --print-toolchain-path argument of lli:     ./path/to/bin/lli --print-toolchain-path    Set the LLVM_TOOLCHAIN environment variable:     export LLVM_TOOLCHAIN=$(./path/to/bin/lli --print-toolchain-path)    Then see the content of the toolchain path for a list of available tools:     ls $LLVM_TOOLCHAIN  Use those tools just as you would for native compilation. For example, save this C code in a file named hello.c:#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;int main() {    printf(&quot;Hello from GraalVM!n&quot;);    return 0;}Then you can compile hello.c to an executable with embedded LLVM bitcode as follows:$LLVM_TOOLCHAIN/clang hello.c -o helloThe resulting executable, hello, can be executed on GraalVM using lli:$JAVA_HOME/bin/lli helloExternal Library DependenciesIf the bitcode file depends on external libraries, GraalVM will automatically pick up the dependencies from the binary headers.For example:#include &amp;lt;unistd.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;ncurses.h&amp;gt;int main() {    initscr();    printw(&quot;Hello, Curses!&quot;);    refresh();    sleep(1);    endwin();    return 0;}This hello-curses.c file can be then compiled and run with:$LLVM_TOOLCHAIN/clang hello-curses.c -lncurses -o hello-curseslli hello-cursesRunning C++For running C++ code, the GraalVM LLVM runtime requires the libc++ standard library from the LLVM project.The LLVM toolchain shipped with GraalVM automatically links against libc++.For example, save this code as a hello-c++.cpp file:#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;int main() {    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &quot;Hello, C++ World!&quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;}Compile it with clang++ shipped with GraalVM and execute:$LLVM_TOOLCHAIN/clang++ hello-c++.cpp -o hello-c++lli hello-c++Hello, C++ World!Running RustThe LLVM toolchain, bundled with GraalVM, does not come with the Rust compiler.To install Rust, run the following in your command prompt, then follow the onscreen instructions:curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | shSave this example Rust code in a hello-rust.rs file:fn main() {    println!(&quot;Hello Rust!&quot;);}This can be then compiled to bitcode with the --emit=llvm-bc flag:rustc --emit=llvm-bc hello-rust.rsTo run the Rust program, we have to tell GraalVM where to find the Rust standard libraries:lli --lib $(rustc --print sysroot)/lib/libstd-* hello-rust.bcHello Rust!Since the Rust compiler is not using the LLVM toolchain shipped with GraalVM, depending on the local Rust installation, an error similar to one of the following might happen:Mismatching target triple (expected x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu, got x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)Mismatching target triple (expected x86_64-apple-macosx10.11.0, got x86_64-apple-darwin)This indicates that the Rust compiler used a different target triple than the LLVM toolchain shipped with GraalVM.In this particular case, the differences are just different naming conventions across Linux distributions or MacOS versions, there is no real difference.In that case, the error can be safely ignored:lli --experimental-options --llvm.verifyBitcode=false --lib $(rustc --print sysroot)/lib/libstd-* hello-rust.bcThis option should only be used after manually verifying that the target triples are really compatible, i.e., the architecture, operating system, and C library all match.For example, x86_64-unknown-linux-musl and x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu are really different, the bitcode is compiled for a different C library.The --llvm.verifyBitcode=false option disables all checks, GraalVM will then try to run the bitcode regardless, which might randomly fail in unexpected ways.",

The most important part is the reasoning behind every guideline - usethat to assess the trade-offs for the specific situation at hand and to chose appropriate solution.One of the general high-level guidelines for partially evaluated (PE) code is to minimize code duplication duringthe PE process. This not only helps the Truffle compilation that uses partial evaluation, but alsohost inlining, whichfollows similar rules to PE when compiling the interpreter.Another general high-level guideline for any Truffle interpreter code is to have as little code as possiblein order to minimize the native-image size. This applies to runtime code and PE code, but is evenmore important for PE code, since native-image also AOT compiles it, but the host-inlining greatlyincreases the amount of code the AOT compilation produces, and on top of that native-image also needsto retain serialized Graal IR graphs of all PE code for runtime compilation.Avoid subclassing for minor changesExample:abstract class MyBaseNode extends Node {  abstract int execute(Object o);  @Specialization(guards = &quot;arg == 0&quot;)  int doZero(int arg) { /* ... */ }  @Specialization(guards = &quot;arg != 0&quot;)  int doInt(int arg) { /* ... */ }  @Specialization  int doOther(Object o) { throw new AbstractMethodError(); }}abstract class Node1 extends MyBaseNode {  @Specialization  @Override  final int doOther(Object o) { return 42; }}abstract class Node2 extends MyBaseNode {  @Specialization  @Override  final int doOther(Object o) { return -1; }}Why: native-image binary sizeTruffle DSL will generate multiple execute and executeAndSpecialize methods,which will contain the same code. Native-image does not deduplicate the code.Solution: use delegation to a child node instead of inheritance or, if the code is simple enough,inline all the implementations and switch on a field value or argument to the execute method.Example of the former:abstract class MyNodeHandleOther extends Node {    abstract int execute(Object o);}abstract class MyNode extends Node {  @Child MyNodeHandleOther otherHandler;  MyNode(MyNodeHandleOther otherHandler) {      this.otherHandler = otherHandler;  }  abstract int execute(Object o);  @Specialization(guards = &quot;arg == 0&quot;)  int doZero(int arg) { /* ... */ }  @Specialization(guards = &quot;arg != 0&quot;)  int doInt(int arg) { /* ... */ }  @Specialization  int doOther(Object o) {      return otherHandler.execute(o);  }}Alternative solution: if the common code is only one @Specialization or there is a simple and efficient guardthat captures all the common @Specializations, then move the common @Specializations to an inline node andin all the former subclasses add one @Specialization that delegates to the common inline node.@GenerateCached(false)@GenerateInlineabstract class MyCommonNode extends Node {  abstract int execute(Node node, Object o);  @Specialization(guards = &quot;arg == 0&quot;)  int doZero(int arg) { /* ... */ }  @Specialization(guards = &quot;arg != 0&quot;)  int doInt(int arg) { /* ... */ }}abstract class Node1 extends Node {    abstract int execute(Object o);    @Specialization    int doInts(int o,               @Cached MyCommonNode node) {        return node.execute(this, o);    }    @Specialization    int doOther(Object o) { return 42; }}// analogically for Node2Avoid duplicated SpecializationsAvoid specializations with (almost) the same method body.When two or more @Specializations differ only in guards or in some minor detail. This includes @Specializationsthat delegate to the same helper method. Example:abstract class MyNode extends Node {  abstract void execute(Object o);  @Specialization  void doObj1(MyObject1 o) { helper(o); }  @Specialization  void doObj2(MyObject2 o) { helper(o); }  void helper(Object o) { /* some code */ }  // ... more @Specializations}Why:  code duplication during PEWe want to reduce code duplication as seen by PE process and not by the developer. Refactoring the codeto a helper method does not help PE, because it explores every call separately.For instance, with host inlining and our code example, the cost of fully inlining Node#execute will be(omitting some details):size(Node#execute) + size(Node#doIt1) + size(Node#doIt2) + 2 * size(Node#helper)Solution: refactor the code to avoid the duplication. The concrete approach differs depending on concretesituation. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. General advice is to try to merge the @Specializationsthat contain the code duplication. One can create an inline node that profiles the now merged conditionsthat used to be implicitly profiled by being separate @Specializations. For example:@GenerateInline@GenerateCached(false)abstract class GuardNode extends Node {  abstract boolean execute(Node inliningTarget, Object o);  @Specialization  static boolean doObj1(MyObject1 o) { return true; }  @Specialization  static boolean doObj2(MyObject2 o) { return true; }  @Fallback  static boolean doFallback(Object o) { return false; }}abstract class MyNode extends Node {  abstract void execute(Object o);  @Specialization(guards = &quot;guardNode.execute(this, o)&quot;, limit = &quot;1&quot;)  void doObj(Object o,             @Cached GuardNode guardNode) { helper(o); }  // ...other @Specializations}Note that if the guard needs to be used for multiple specializations, or will be used by generated fallback guard,we are duplicating the guard logic in the same way as we were duplicating the logic inside the specializations.This may be acceptable as guards tend to be simple, but the user needs to assess if that is a good trade-off.Avoid duplicated calls to helper methods/nodesExample:@Specializationvoid doDefault(boolean b, Object o) {  if (b) {    helper.execute(o, 42);  } else {    helper.execute(o, -1);  }}Why: code duplication during PEThe PE process has to explore each call separately and only in later phases the Graal compiler may deduplicate the code.Solution: common-out the calls if possible  int num = b ? 42 : -1;  helper.execute(o, num);Mixing @Shared and non-@Shared inline nodes/profilesAvoid mixing @Shared and non-@Shared inline nodes/profiles in one @Specialization if Truffle DSL generates“data-class” for the @Specialization.Example:@GenerateInline(false)class MyNode extends Node {  // ...  @Specialization  void doIt(...,      @Bind(&quot;this&quot;) Node node,      /* more @Cached arguments such that data-class is generated */      @Exclusive @Cached InlinedBranchProfile b1,      @Shared @Cached InlinedBranchProfile b2)Why: Truffle DSL generates code that is less efficient in the interpreter.In our example: non-shared inline profile has its data stored in the data-class object, but the shared inline profilehas its data stored in the instance of MyNode. However, both profiles receive the same node argument,which will be an instance of the generated data-class, so the shared profile must call node.getParent() to accessits data stored in MyNode. In general, such inline nodes/profiles may need to traverse multiple parent pointersuntil they reach their data.Note: this does not concern any non-inline nodes, it is OK to mix those, and it is OK to mix them with inline nodes,however, inline nodes used in one @Specialization should be either all shared or all exclusive.Solution: change the @Shared nodes/profiles to @Exclusive or refactor the code such that sharing is notnecessary anymore. Usage of @Shared (not only inline nodes/profiles) can be a sign ofduplicated @Specializations, and refactoring the @Specializations will resolve the problem.If the footprint benefit outweighs the possible interpreter performance degradation, this guideline can be ignored.Generic solution that trades off some code readability for good interpreter performance and lower footprint at thesame time is to split the code into two nodes, where the outer node takes only the shared inline nodes/profilesand the inner node takes only the non-shared. The outer node can execute some common logic and also forward theshared nodes along with their inlining target node to the inner node.Avoid unused large inline nodesAvoid inlining large nodes that are used only on rarely executed code-paths.Example:@Specializationvoid doObject(Object arg,    @Bind(&quot;this&quot;) Node inliningTarget,    @Cached LargeInlineNode n) {    if (arg == null) {        // unlikely situation        n.execute(inliningTarget, ...);    }}Why: runtime memory footprintAll the fields of LargeInlineNode node will be inlined into the caller node (or Specialization data-class)increasing its memory footprint significantly.For code-paths that are not performance sensitive in the interpreter, better alternative isthe lazily initialized nodes.For Code-paths that are performance sensitive in the interpreter:  The footprint increase may be justified by the performance  Use the handwritten lazily initialized @Child field pattern if applicable  If possible restructure the code to avoid such situationAvoid generating cached, uncached, and inline variant of one nodeIf possible avoid having all three variants, because it increases the PE code footprint.",

          "title": "Truffle DSL Node Object Inlining",
          "content": "Truffle DSL Node Object InliningIn 23.0, we have introduced a new annotation called @GenerateInline. This annotation instructs the Truffle DSL annotation processor to generate an inlinable version of a node. This works analogously to @GenerateCached and @GenerateUncached, which generate a cached or uncached node version.By default, the DSL does not generate an inlined version of a node.Node inlining provides a simple way to reduce the memory footprint of nodes but often also improves interpreter execution speed.Basic UsageLet us assume we have a node with specializations that computes the sum of the absolute value of two values.For simplicity, we will only look at the long typed specializations in this example.A runnable but slightly more advanced version of this example can be found in the Truffle unit tests.  NodeInliningExample1_1.java shows an example without any inlining.  NodeInliningExample1_2.java shows an example without partial inlining.  NodeInliningExample1_3.java shows an example with full inlining.Consider the following examples that specify two regular nodes it specializations. One node computes the sum of two values, and one computes the absolute number of a number. The AbsNode is then reused in the AddAbsNode to share the implementation.public abstract class AddAbsNode extends Node {    abstract long execute(Object left, Object right);    @Specialization    long add(long left, long right,                    @Cached AbsNode leftAbs,                    @Cached AbsNode rightAbs) {        return leftAbs.execute(left) + rightAbs.execute(right);    }    // ...}public abstract class AbsNode extends Node {    abstract long execute(long value);    @Specialization(guards = &quot;v &amp;gt;= 0&quot;)    long doInt(long v) {        return v;    }    @Specialization(guards = &quot;v &amp;lt; 0&quot;)    long doLong(long v) {        return -v;    }}The compressed memory footprint for AbsNode and AddAbsNode after one execution are computed as follows:AbsNodeGen = object header   + Node field for Node.parent   + int field for stateAddAbsNodeGen = object header   + Node field for Node.parent   + int  field for state   + Node field for @Cached AbsNode leftAbs   + Node field for @Cached AbsNode rightAbsFootprint = headerCount * 12 + pointerCount * 4 + primitiveByteSizeFootprint = 3 * 12 + 5 * 4 + 12 = 68 bytesTherefore, we use 68 bytes to represent a single operation with nodes.With 23.0, the Truffle DSL annotation processor will produce the following warning for the AbsNode class:This node is a candidate for node object inlining. The memory footprint is estimated to be reduced from 20 to 1 byte(s). Add @GenerateInline(true) to enable object inlining for this node or @GenerateInline(false) to disable this warning. Also, consider disabling cached node generation with @GenerateCached(false) if all usages will be inlined. This warning may be suppressed using @SuppressWarnings(&quot;truffle-inlining&quot;).Following the recommendation of this warning, we modify our example as follows by adding the @GenerateInline annotation:@GenerateInlinepublic abstract class AbsNode extends Node {    abstract long execute(long value);    @Specialization(guards = &quot;v &amp;gt;= 0&quot;)    long doInt(long v) {        return v;    }    @Specialization(guards = &quot;v &amp;lt; 0&quot;)    long doLong(long v) {        return -v;    }}Now the DSL reports a compile error for AbsNode:Error generating code for @GenerateInline: Found non-final execute method without a node parameter execute(long). Inlinable nodes must use the Node type as the first parameter after the optional frame for all non-final execute methods. A valid signature for an inlinable node is execute([VirtualFrame frame, ] Node node, ...).For inlinable nodes, we must pass a node parameter to the execute method as the first parameter.This is necessary as inlined nodes become singletons and no longer have their own state, but instead, it is passed as a parameter to the execute method.Again, we follow the error and modify our example as follows:@GenerateInlinepublic abstract class AbsNode extends Node {    abstract long execute(Node node, long value);    @Specialization(guards = &quot;v &amp;gt;= 0&quot;)    static long doInt(long v) {        return v;    }    @Specialization(guards = &quot;v &amp;lt; 0&quot;)    static long doLong(long v) {        return -v;    }}Note that the node parameter is optional for specialization methods, but they are typically needed if transitively inlined nodes are used.Next, we also need to modify AddAbsNode to pass this as a node parameter to the new execute signature:public abstract static class AddAbsNode extends Node {    abstract long execute(long left, long right);    @Specialization    long add(long left, long right,                    @Cached AbsNode leftAbs,                    @Cached AbsNode rightAbs) {        return leftAbs.execute(this, left) + rightAbs.execute(this, right);    }    // ...}The DSL now produces a warning for each of the @Cached AbsNode parameters:The cached type &#39;AbsNode&#39; supports object-inlining. The footprint is estimated to be reduced from 36 to 1 byte(s). Set @Cached(..., inline=true|false) to determine whether object-inlining should be performed. Alternatively, @GenerateCached(alwaysInlineCached=true) can be used to enable inlining for an entire class or in combination with the inherit option for a hierarchy of node classes. This warning may be suppressed using @SuppressWarnings(&quot;truffle-inlining&quot;).We follow the recommendation in this message and enable object inlining:public abstract static class AddAbsNode extends Node {    abstract long execute(long left, long right);    @Specialization    long add(long left, long right,                    @Cached(inline = true) AbsNode leftAbs,                    @Cached(inline = true) AbsNode rightAbs) {        return leftAbs.execute(this, left) + rightAbs.execute(this, right);    }    // ...}Now we have achieved object-inlining of AbsNode into  AddAbsNode.The new memory footprint computes as follows:AddAbsNodeGen = object header   + Node field for Node.parent   + int  field for stateFootprint = headerCount * 12 + pointerCount * 4 + primitiveByteSizeFootprint = 1 * 12 + 1 * 4 + 4 = 20 bytesThe footprint has gone down from 68 bytes to only 20 bytes for each instance of AddAbsNodeGen.But we are still going. Since all cached nodes are inlined we can also make the AddAbsNode inlinable for its usages.The DSL helps us again by detecting such cases and prints a warning for AddAbsNode now:This node is a candidate for node object inlining. The memory footprint is estimated to be reduced from 20 to 1 byte(s). Add @GenerateInline(true) to enable object inlining for this node or @GenerateInline(false) to disable this warning. Also consider disabling cached node generation with @GenerateCached(false) if all usages will be inlined. This warning may be suppressed using @SuppressWarnings(&quot;truffle-inlining&quot;).Again, we follow the guide and add a @GenerateInline annotation to AddAbsNode. Just like before, we also add a Node parameter to the execute method:@GenerateInlinepublic abstract static class AddAbsNode extends Node {    abstract long execute(Node node, long left, long right);    @Specialization    static long add(Node node, long left, long right,                    @Cached AbsNode leftAbs,                    @Cached AbsNode rightAbs) {        return leftAbs.execute(node, left) + rightAbs.execute(node, right);    }    // ...}We also need to use the Node parameter in the specialization method and pass it on to the child nodes.Again, we want all specializations to be static to avoid accidentally passing this.In addition, the DSL complained about the inline=true attribute, which is now always implied as the parent node uses the @GenerateInline annotation.To measure the overhead of our new inlinable AddAbsNode node, we declare a new operation called Add4AbsNode that adds four numbers using our AddAbsNode operation:@GenerateCached(alwaysInlineCached = true)public abstract static class Add4AbsNode extends Node {    abstract long execute(long v0, long v1, long v2, long v3);    @Specialization    long doInt(long v0, long v1, long v2, long v3,                    @Cached AddAbsNode add0,                    @Cached AddAbsNode add1,                    @Cached AddAbsNode add2) {        long v;        v = add0.execute(this, v0, v1);        v = add1.execute(this, v, v2);        v = add2.execute(this, v, v3);        return v;    }}This time, instead of specifying @Cached(inline=true), we auto-enable inlining wherever possible using @GenerateCached(alwaysInlineCached = true).Depending on the use case, it can hinder readability to repeat individual inlining commands for every cached node.Computing the overhead now becomes more tricky. We need to understand how many state bits each node requires to keep track of active specializations.That computation is generally implementation specific and subject to change. However, a good rule of thumb is that the DSL requires one bit per declared specialization.Implicit casts, replace rules, @Fallback and specializations with multiple instances may further increase the number of required state bits.For this example, each AddAbsNode requires 5 bits. 2 bits for each of the AbsNode usages and one bit for the AddAbsNode specializations.The Add4AbsNode uses three instances of AddAbsNode, has one specialization, and therefore needs 3 * 5 + 1 state bits in total.Since the number of bits is below 32, we can assume that we need a single int field in the generated code.The memory footprint of an executed Add4AbsNode is therefore computed as follows:Footprint = 1 * 12 + 1 * 4 + 4 = 20 bytesAs you can see, this is the same memory footprint a single AddAbsNode had.If we use the same formula to compute the memory footprint of an Add4AbsNode without any object inliningFootprint = 1 * 12 + 4 * 4 + 4 + 3 * 68 = 236 bytesWe have reduced the overhead from 236 bytes to 20 bytes.In addition to the memory footprint advantages, interpreter-only execution may be faster, as we save the reads for the node fields and benefit from better CPU cache locality due to smaller memory consumption.After compilation using partial evaluation, both cached and uncached versions are expected to perform the same.There is a last thing we should do. Since our AddAbsNode and AbsNode are no longer used in their cached version, we can turn off cached generation using @GenerateCached(false) to save Java code footprint.After doing this we can omit the alwaysInlineCached property in the @GenerateCached annotation as nodes are automatically inlined if only an inlined version is available.This is the final example:@GenerateInline@GenerateCached(false)public abstract static class AbsNode extends Node {    abstract long execute(Node node, long value);    @Specialization(guards = &quot;v &amp;gt;= 0&quot;)    static long doInt(long v) {        return v;    }    @Specialization(guards = &quot;v &amp;lt; 0&quot;)    static long doLong(long v) {        return -v;    }}@GenerateInline@GenerateCached(false)public abstract static class AddAbsNode extends Node {    abstract long execute(Node node, long left, long right);    @Specialization    static long add(Node node, long left, long right,                    @Cached AbsNode leftAbs,                    @Cached AbsNode rightAbs) {        return leftAbs.execute(node, left) + rightAbs.execute(node, right);    }    // ...}@GenerateCached(alwaysInlineCached = true)@GenerateInline(false)public abstract static class Add4AbsNode extends Node {    abstract long execute(long v0, long v1, long v2, long v3);    @Specialization    long doInt(long v0, long v1, long v2, long v3,                    @Cached AddAbsNode add0,                    @Cached AddAbsNode add1,                    @Cached AddAbsNode add2) {        long v;        v = add0.execute(this, v0, v1);        v = add1.execute(this, v, v2);        v = add2.execute(this, v, v3);        return v;    }}Note that the DSL again informed us that Add4AbsNode could use @GenerateInline by emitting the following warning:This node is a candidate for node object inlining. The memory footprint is estimated to be reduced from 20 to 2 byte(s). Add @GenerateInline(true) to enable object inlining for this node or @GenerateInline(false) to disable this warning. Also consider disabling cached node generation with @GenerateCached(false) if all usages will be inlined. This warning may be suppressed using @SuppressWarnings(&quot;truffle-inlining&quot;).This time we suppressed the warning by explicitly specifying @GenerateInline(false).Advanced Inline Cache UsageThe following example explains how specialization unrolling and new inlinable cache classes can be helpful in reducing the memory footprint of nodes with specializations that have multiple instances.Examples:  NodeInliningExample2_1.java shows an example without any inlining.  NodeInliningExample2_2.java shows an example without partial inlining.  NodeInliningExample2_3.java shows an example with full inlining.Passing along Nodes correctlyThe usage of inlined nodes requires to access and pass the correct node to execute methods of the respective inlined nodes.It is a common mistake to pass the wrong node to execute methods.Typically such mistakes fail with an error at runtime, but the DSL also emits warnings and errors depending on the situation at compile time.Inlined NodesFor inlined nodes that use themselves inlined nodes it is sufficient to pass a long the Node dynamic parameter.For example. in the previous section we used AddAbsNode with a similar pattern:@GenerateInline@GenerateCached(false)public abstract static class AddAbsNode extends Node {    abstract long execute(Node node, long left, long right);    @Specialization    static long add(Node node, long left, long right,                    @Cached AbsNode leftAbs,                    @Cached AbsNode rightAbs) {        return leftAbs.execute(node, left) + rightAbs.execute(node, right);    }    // ...}Cached Nodes with Multiple InstancesFor nodes with specializations that may have multiple instances a @Bind(&quot;this&quot;) Node node parameter must be used to access the inline target node.This is simliar to the SumArrayNode node in the advanced usage example.@ImportStatic(AbstractArray.class)public abstract static class SumArrayNode extends Node {    abstract int execute(Object v0);    @Specialization(guards = {&quot;kind != null&quot;, &quot;kind.type == array.getClass()&quot;}, limit = &quot;2&quot;, unroll = 2)    static int doDefault(Object array,                    @Bind(&quot;this&quot;) Node node,                    @Cached(&quot;resolve(array)&quot;) ArrayKind kind,                    @Cached GetStoreNode getStore) {        Object castStore = kind.type.cast(array);        int[] store = getStore.execute(node, castStore);        int sum = 0;        for (int element : store) {            sum += element;            TruffleSafepoint.poll(node);        }        return sum;    }    static Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; getCachedClass(Object array) {        if (array instanceof AbstractArray) {            return array.getClass();        }        return null;    }}Exported Library MessagesFor exported library messages the this keyword is already reserved for the receiver value, so $node can be used instead.For example:    @ExportLibrary(ExampleArithmeticLibrary.class)    static class ExampleNumber {        final long value;        /* ... */        @ExportMessage        final long abs(@Bind(&quot;$node&quot;) Node node,                       @Cached InlinedConditionProfile profile) {            if (profile.profile(node, this.value &amp;gt;= 0)) {                return  this.value;            } else {                return  -this.value;            }        }    }LimitationsNode object inlining supports arbitrary deep nestings. However, there are some limitations to using @GenerateInline.  There must not be any instance fields on the node class or a parent class.  The node must not use @NodeField or @NodeChild.  The usage of inlined nodes must not be recursive.Manually implementing Inlinable Nodes and ProfilesNodes or profiles that can be inlined in the DSL can also be implemented manually.The class must implement a static method called inline.For example, most inlinable Truffle profiles use custom inlining.Extra care must be taken when implementing such inlinable classes and if possible, a DSL generated node should be used instead.See InlinedBranchProfile or InlinedIntValueProfile class as an example on how to implement the inline method.API Compatibility for Inlinable NodesThe TruffleString API extensively uses DSL nodes like in the above example.However, allowing nodes to be inlined makes every change to the specializations of that node an incompatible API change.This is because the signature of the static inline method changes depending on the required state bits of the specializations.In order to support inlining across stable API boundaries, it is recommended to manually specify an inline method that forwards to the generated inline method.As an example, consider the following node:@GenerateInline@GenerateUncached@GeneratePackagePrivatepublic abstract static class APINode extends Node {    abstract long execute(Node node, long value);    @Specialization(guards = &quot;v &amp;gt;= 0&quot;)    static long doInt(long v) {        return v;    }    @Specialization(guards = &quot;v &amp;lt; 0&quot;)    static long doLong(long v) {        return -v;    }    public static APINode inline(@RequiredField(value = StateField.class, bits = 32) InlineContext context) {        return APINodeGen.inline(context);    }    public static APINode create() {        return APINodeGen.create();    }    public static APINode getUncached() {        return APINodeGen.getUncached();    }}We use @GeneratePackagePrivate in order not to expose any generated code as public.We specify a manual inline method that specifies the required bits for this node.If the specializations of a node require more bits or more additional fields other than specified, then the annotation processor fails with an error.If the node requires fewer bits, then this does not cause any compiler error.This allows API to use node inlining across stable API boundaries as long as the reserved field capacity is not exceeded.A change is compatible if:  There was previously no inline method for this node before.  If the required bit space is reduced and all other fields are changed.A change is incompatible if:  A new @RequiredField annotation to an existing inline method was added or removed.  The required bits were increased.The DSL validates whether the required fields are matching to the state specification of the parent node and emits a warning if it is not compatible to the node specification.Lazy Initialized Nodes with DSL InliningFull source code of the example: NodeInliningAndLazyInitExample.java.DSL inlining can be used to provide lazy initialization for otherwise cached node that is only used in code blocks thatare protected by conditions that trigger rarely. Consider this example:@GenerateInline(false)@GenerateUncachedpublic abstract static class RaiseErrorNode extends Node {    abstract void execute(Object type, String message);    // ...}@GenerateInline(false)@GenerateUncached(false)public abstract static class LazyInitExampleBefore extends Node {    abstract void execute(Object value);    @Specialization    void doIt(Object value,              @Cached RaiseErrorNode raiseError) {        Object result = doSomeWork(value);        if (result == null) {            raiseError.execute(value, &quot;Error: doSomeWork returned null&quot;);        }    }}RaiseErrorNode is always instantiated even-though we do not need it if doSomeWork always returnsnon null result at runtime. Before DSL inlining, this issue was usually solved by lazy-initialized@Child node:@GenerateInline(false)@GenerateUncached(false)public abstract static class LazyInitExampleBefore2 extends Node {    @Child RaiseErrorNode raiseError;    abstract void execute(Object value);    @Specialization    void doIt(Object value) {        Object result = doSomeWork(value);        if (result == null) {            if (raiseError == null) {                CompilerDirectives.transferToInterpreterAndInvalidate();                raiseError = insert(RaiseErrorNodeGen.create());            }            raiseError.execute(value, &quot;Error: doSomeWork returned null&quot;);        }    }}However @Child nodes have some drawbacks. Most notably, the @Specialization cannot be static and wecannot generate uncached variant of the node.With DSL inlining, one should either make the RaiseErrorNode inlineable if beneficial, or if it is a node that:  has a lot of specializations with multiple instances, or  cannot currently be inlined, or  has a lot of cached fields that cannot be inlinedthen one can create an inlinable wrapper node that initializes the RaiseErrorNode on demand:@GenerateInline@GenerateUncached@GenerateCached(false)public abstract static class LazyRaiseNode extends Node {    public final RaiseErrorNode get(Node node) {        return execute(node);    }    abstract RaiseErrorNode execute(Node node);    @Specialization    static RaiseErrorNode doIt(@Cached(inline = false) RaiseErrorNode node) {        return node;    }}@GenerateInline(false)@GenerateUncachedpublic abstract static class LazyInitExample extends Node {    abstract void execute(Object value);    @Specialization    void doIt(Object value,              @Cached LazyRaiseNode raiseError) {        Object result = doSomeWork(value);        if (result == null) {            raiseError.get(this).execute(value, &quot;Error: doSomeWork returned null&quot;);        }    }}Unless LazyRaiseNode.execute gets called, the cost of the wrapper is single reference fieldand one bit from the bitset of LazyInitExample node. Except for the extra bit, it is the same aswith the lazy initialized @Child node field.Note that, at the moment, the lazy initialization pattern cannot be fully inlined byhost inlining,and it is therefore not recommended to be used on interpreter hot code-paths.",

          "content": "Truffle DSL WarningsSince version 23.0, Truffle DSL now produces significantly more warnings. These warnings are intended to guide the user to better DSL usage.The following sections describe how to handle and eventually suppress warnings.All warnings of Truffle DSL can be suppressed using the -Atruffle.dsl.SuppressAllWarnings=true option. If a language uses strict checks where warnings are treated as errors in their CI, it is recommended to add this option to the Java compilation command line. This can be useful to avoid CI failures when Truffle DSL adds new warning messages. Adding new warning messages in Truffle DSL is considered a compatible change.Truffle DSL warnings can be suppressed just like Java warnings using the @SuppressWarnings annotation or with@SuppressPackageWarnings for entire packages.The following warning keys are supported:  all all warnings emitted by the Java compiler or Truffle DSL  truffle all warnings emitted by Truffle DSL  truffle-sharing warnings when the DSL recommends sharing between cached values  truffle-inlining warnings when the DSL recommends using node object inlining.  truffle-neverdefault warnings for when cached initializers should be marked as never having a default value.  truffle-limit warnings when a specialization limit is recommended, but not specified.  truffle-static-method warnings when the DSL recommends to use the static modifier.  truffle-unused warnings if a DSL attribute or annotation has no effect and is recommended to be removed.  truffle-abstract-export warnings if an abstract message of a Truffle library is not exported.  truffle-assumption if the assumptions feature is used with a specialization that reaches a @Fallback specialization.  truffle-guard if a guard uses methods where a @Idempotent or @NonIdempotent method may be beneficial for the generated code.Specific warnings can also be suppressed globally using the -Atruffle.dsl.SuppressWarnings=truffle-inlining,truffle-neverdefault Java compiler processor option. Note that also Java system properties can be used to configure the annotation processor. (e.g. by passing -J-Dtruffle.dsl.SuppressWarnings=truffle-inlining,truffle-neverdefault to javac)Suppressing a specific warning should be preferred over suppressing all warnings.Find the latest list of warnings in the source code",

          "title": "Debug Info Feature",
          "content": "Debug Info FeatureTo add debug information to a generated native image, provide the -g option to the native-image builder:native-image -g HelloThe -g flag instructs native-image to generate debug information.The resulting image will contain debug records in a format the GNU Debugger (GDB) understands.Additionally, you can pass -O0 to the builder which specifies that no compiler optimizations should be performed.Disabling all optimizations is not required, but in general it makes the debugging experience better.Debug information is not just useful to the debugger. It can also be used by the Linux performance profiling tools perf and valgrind to correlate execution statistics such as CPU utilization or cache misses with specific, named Java methods and even link them to individual lines of Java code in the original Java source file.By default, debug info will only include details of some of the values of parameters and local variables.This means that the debugger will report many parameters and local variables as being undefined. If you pass -O0 to the builder then full debug information will be included.If youwant more parameter and local variable information to be included when employing higherlevels of optimization (-O1 or, the default, -O2) you need to pass an extra commandline flag to the native-image commandnative-image -g -H:+SourceLevelDebug HelloEnabling debuginfo with flag -g does not make any difference to how a generatednative image is compiled and does not affect how fast it executes nor how much memory it uses at runtime.However, it can significantly increase the size of the generated image on disk. Enabling full parameterand local variable information by passing flag -H:+SourceLevelDebug can cause a program to be compiledslightly differently and for some applications this can slow down execution.The basic perf report command, which displays a histogram showing percentage execution time in each Java method, only requires passing flags -g and -H:+SourceLevelDebug to the native-image command.However, more sophisticated uses of perf (i.e. perf annotate) and use ofvalgrind requires debug info to be supplemented with linkage symbols identifying compiled Java methods.Java method symbols are omitted from the generated native image by default but they can be retained achieved by passing one extra flag to the native-image commandnative-image -g -H:+SourceLevelDebug -H:-DeleteLocalSymbols HelloUse of this flag will result in a small increase in the size of theresulting image file.  Note: Native Image debugging currently works on Linux with initial support for macOS. The feature is experimental.  Note: Debug info support for perf and valgrind on Linux is an experimental feature.Table of Contents  Source File Caching  Special Considerations for Debugging Java from GDB  Identifying Source Code Location  Configuring Source Paths in GNU Debugger  Checking Debug Info on Linux  Debugging with Isolates  Debugging Helper Methods  Special Considerations for using perf and valgrindSource File CachingThe -g option also enables caching of sources for any JDK runtime classes, GraalVM classes, and application classes which can be located when generating a native executable.By default, the cache is created alongside the generated binary in a subdirectory named sources.If a target directory for the native executable is specified using option -H:Path=... then the cache is also relocated under that same target. Use a command line option to provide an alternative path to sources and to configure source file search path roots for the debugger.Files in the cache are located in a directory hierarchy that matches the file path information included in the debug records of the native executable.The source cache should contain all the files needed to debug the generated binary and nothing more.This local cache provides a convenient way of making just the necessary sources available to the debugger or IDE when debugging a native executable.The implementation tries to be smart about locating source files.It uses the current JAVA_HOME to locate the JDK src.zip when searching for JDK runtime sources.It also uses entries in the classpath to suggest locations for GraalVM source files and application source files (see below for precise details of the scheme used to identify source locations).However, source layouts do vary and it may not be possible to find all sources.Hence, users can specify the location of source files explicitly on the command line using option DebugInfoSourceSearchPath:javac --source-path apps/greeter/src     -d apps/greeter/classes org/my/greeter/*Greeter.javajavac -cp apps/greeter/classes     --source-path apps/hello/src     -d apps/hello/classes org/my/hello/Hello.javanative-image -g     -H:DebugInfoSourceSearchPath=apps/hello/src     -H:DebugInfoSourceSearchPath=apps/greeter/src     -cp apps/hello/classes:apps/greeter/classes org.my.hello.HelloThe DebugInfoSourceSearchPath option can be repeated as many times as required to notify all the target source locations.The value passed to this option can be either an absolute or relative path.It can identify either a directory, a source JAR, or a source ZIP file.It is also possible to specify several source roots at once using a comma separator:native-image -g     -H:DebugInfoSourceSearchPath=apps/hello/target/hello-sources.jar,apps/greeter/target/greeter-sources.jar     -cp apps/target/hello.jar:apps/target/greeter.jar     org.my.HelloBy default, the cache of application, GraalVM, and JDK sources is created in a directory named sources.The DebugInfoSourceCacheRoot option can be used to specify an alternative path, which can be absolute or relative.In the latter case the path is interpreted relative to the target directory for the generated executable specified via option -H:Path (which defaults to the current working directory).As an example, the following variant of the previous command specifies an absolute temporary directory path constructed using the current process id:SOURCE_CACHE_ROOT=/tmp/$$/sourcesnative-image -g     -H:DebugInfoSourceCacheRoot=$SOURCE_CACHE_ROOT     -H:DebugInfoSourceSearchPath=apps/hello/target/hello-sources.jar,apps/greeter/target/greeter-sources.jar     -cp apps/target/hello.jar:apps/target/greeter.jar     org.my.HelloThe resulting cache directory will be something like /tmp/1272696/sources.If the source cache path includes a directory that does not yet exist, it will be created during population of the cache.Note that in all the examples above the DebugInfoSourceSearchPath options are actually redundant.In the first case, the classpath entries for apps/hello/classes and apps/greeter/classes will be used to derive the default search roots apps/hello/src and apps/greeter/src.In the second case, the classpath entries for apps/target/hello.jar and apps/target/greeter.jar will be used to derive the default search roots apps/target/hello-sources.jar and apps/target/greeter-sources.jar.Supported FeaturesThe currently supported features include:  break points configured by file and line, or by method name  single stepping by line including both into and over function calls  stack backtraces (not including frames detailing inlined code)  printing of primitive values  structured (field by field) printing of Java objects  casting/printing objects at different levels of generality  access through object networks via path expressions  reference by name to methods and static field data  reference by name to values bound to parameter and local vars  reference by name to class constantsNote that single stepping within a compiled method includes file and line number info for inlined code, including inlined GraalVM methods.So, GDB may switch files even though you are still in the same compiled method.Special considerations for debugging Java from GDBGDB does not currently include support for Java debugging.In consequence, debug capability has been implemented by generating debug info that models the Java program as an equivalent C++ program. Java class, array and interface references are actually pointers to records that contain the relevant field/array data.In the corresponding C++ model the Java name is used to label the underlying C++ (class/struct) layout types and Java references appear as pointers.So, for example in the DWARF debug info model java.lang.String identifies a C++ class.This class layout type declares the expected fields like hash of type int and value of type byte[] and methods like String(byte[]), charAt(int), etc. However, the copy constructor which appears in Java as String(String) appears in gdb with the signature String(java.lang.String *).The C++ layout class inherits fields and methods from class (layout) type java.lang.Object using C++ public inheritance.The latter in turn inherits standard oop (ordinary object pointer) header fields from a special struct class named _objhdr which includes up to two fields (depending on the VM configuration).The first field is called hub and its type is java.lang.Class * i.e. it is a pointer to the object’s class.The second field (optional) is called idHash and has type int.It stores an identity hashcode for the object.The ptype command can be used to print details of a specific type.Note that the Java type name must be specified in quotes because to escape the embedded . characters.(gdb) ptype &#39;java.lang.String&#39;type = class java.lang.String : public java.lang.Object {  private:    byte [] *value;    int hash;    byte coder;  public:    void String(byte [] *);    void String(char [] *);    void String(byte [] *, java.lang.String *);    . . .    char charAt(int);    . . .    java.lang.String * concat(java.lang.String *);    . . .}The ptype command can also be used to identify the static type of a Javadata value. The current example session is for a simple hello worldprogram. Main method Hello.main is passed a single parameterargs whose Java type is String[]. If the debugger is stopped atentry to main we can use ptype to print the type of args.(gdb) ptype argstype = class java.lang.String[] : public java.lang.Object {  public:    int len;    java.lang.String *data[0];} *There are a few details worth highlighting here. Firstly, the debuggersees a Java array reference as a pointer type, as it does every Java objectreference.Secondly, the pointer points to a structure, actually a C++ class,that models the layout of the Java array using an integer length fieldand a data field whose type is a C++ array embedded into the block ofmemory that models the array object.Elements of the array data field are references to the base type, inthis case pointers to java.lang.String. The data array has a nominallength of 0. However, the block of memory allocated for the String[]object actually includes enough space to hold the number of pointersdetermined by the value of field len.Finally, notice that the C++ class java.lang.String[] inherits fromthe C++ class java.lang.Object. So, an array is still also an object.In particular, as we will see when we print the object contents, thismeans that every array also includes the object header fields that allJava objects share.The print command can be used to display the object reference as a memoryaddress.(gdb) print args$1 = (java.lang.String[] *) 0x7ffff7c01130It can also be used to print the contents of the object field by field. Thisis achieved by dereferencing the pointer using the * operator.(gdb) print *args$2 = {  &amp;lt;java.lang.Object&amp;gt; = {    &amp;lt;_objhdr&amp;gt; = {      hub = 0xaa90f0,      idHash = 0    }, &amp;lt;No data fields&amp;gt;},   members of java.lang.String[]:  len = 1,  data = 0x7ffff7c01140}The array object contains embedded fields inherited from class_objhdr via parent class Object. _objhdr is a synthetic typeadded to the deubg info to model fields that are present at the startof all objects. They include hub which is a reference to the object’sclass and hashId a unique numeric hash code.Clearly, the debugger knows the type (java.lang.String[]) and locationin memory (0x7ffff7c010b8) of local variable args. It also knows aboutthe layout of the fields embedded in the referenced object. This meansit is possible to use the C++ . and -&amp;gt; operators in debugger commandsto traverse the underlying object data structures.(gdb) print args-&amp;gt;data[0]$3 = (java.lang.String *) 0x7ffff7c01160(gdb) print *args-&amp;gt;data[0]$4 = {   &amp;lt;java.lang.Object&amp;gt; = {     &amp;lt;_objhdr&amp;gt; = {      hub = 0xaa3350     }, &amp;lt;No data fields&amp;gt;},   members of java.lang.String:   value = 0x7ffff7c01180,   hash = 0,   coder = 0 &#39;000&#39; }(gdb) print *args-&amp;gt;data[0]-&amp;gt;value$5 = {  &amp;lt;java.lang.Object&amp;gt; = {    &amp;lt;_objhdr&amp;gt; = {      hub = 0xaa3068,      idHash = 0    }, &amp;lt;No data fields&amp;gt;},   members of byte []:  len = 6,  data = 0x7ffff7c01190 &quot;Andrew&quot;}Returning to the hub field in the object header it wasmentioned before that this is actually a reference to the object’sclass. This is actually an instance of Java type java.lang.Class.Note that the field is typed by gdb using a pointerto the underlying C++ class (layout) type.(gdb) print args-&amp;gt;hub$6 = (java.lang.Class *) 0xaa90f0All classes, from Object downwards inherit from a common, automatically generated header type _objhdr.It is this header type which includes the hub field:(gdb) ptype _objhdrtype = struct _objhdr {    java.lang.Class *hub;    int idHash;}(gdb) ptype &#39;java.lang.Object&#39;type = class java.lang.Object : public _objhdr {  public:    void Object(void);    . . .The fact that all objects have a common header pointing to a classmakes it possible to perform a simple test to decide if an addressis an object reference and, if so,  what the object’s class is.Given a valid object reference it is always possible to print thecontents of the String referenced from the hub’s name field.Note that as a consequence, this allows every object observed by the debuggerto be downcast to its dynamic type. i.e. even if the debugger only sees the statictype of e.g. java.nio.file.Path we can easily downcast to the dynamic type, whichmight be a subtype such as jdk.nio.zipfs.ZipPath, thus making it possible to inspectfields that we would not be able to observe from the static type alone.First the value is cast to an object reference.Then a path expression is used to dereference through the the hub field and the hub’s name field to the byte[] value array located in the name String.(gdb) print/x ((_objhdr *)$rdi)$7 = (_objhdr *) 0x7ffff7c01130(gdb) print *$7-&amp;gt;hub-&amp;gt;name-&amp;gt;value$8 = {  &amp;lt;java.lang.Object&amp;gt; = {    &amp;lt;_objhdr&amp;gt; = {      hub = 0xaa3068,      idHash = 178613527    }, &amp;lt;No data fields&amp;gt;},    members of byte []:   len = 19,  data = 0x8779c8 &quot;[Ljava.lang.String;&quot; }The value in register rdi is obviously a reference to a String array.Indeed, this is no coincidence. The example session has stopped at a breakpoint placed at the entry to Hello.main and at that point the value forthe String[] parameter args will be located in register rdi. Lookingback we can see that the value in rdi is the same value as was printed bycommand print args.A simpler command which allows just the name of the hub object to be printed is as follows:(gdb) x/s $7-&amp;gt;hub-&amp;gt;name-&amp;gt;value-&amp;gt;data798:&quot;[Ljava.lang.String;&quot;Indeed it is useful to define a gdb command hubname_raw to execute this operation on an arbitrary raw memory address.define hubname_raw  x/s ((&#39;java.lang.Object&#39; *)($arg0))-&amp;gt;hub-&amp;gt;name-&amp;gt;value-&amp;gt;dataend(gdb) hubname_raw $rdi0x8779c8:&quot;[Ljava.lang.String;&quot;Attempting to print the hub name for an invalid reference will failsafe, printing an error message.(gdb) p/x $rdx$5 = 0x2(gdb) hubname $rdxCannot access memory at address 0x2If gdb already knows the Java type for a reference it can be printed without casting using a simpler version of the hubname command.For example, the String array retrieved above as $1 has a known type.(gdb) ptype $1type = class java.lang.String[] : public java.lang.Object {    int len;    java.lang.String *data[0];} *define hubname  x/s (($arg0))-&amp;gt;hub-&amp;gt;name-&amp;gt;value-&amp;gt;dataend(gdb) hubname $10x8779c8:&quot;[Ljava.lang.String;&quot;The native image heap contains a unique hub object (i.e. instance ofjava.lang.Class) for every Java type that is included in theimage.

The native-image tool tries to achieve this by accumulating the relevant sources in a suitably structured file cache.The native-image tool uses different strategies to locate source files for JDK runtime classes, GraalVM classes, and application source classes for inclusion in the local sources cache.It identifies which strategy to use based on the package name of the class.So, for example, packages starting with java.* or jdk.* are JDK classes; packages starting with org.graal.* or com.oracle.svm.* are GraalVM classes; any other packages are regarded as application classes.Sources for JDK runtime classes are retrieved from the src.zip found in the JDK release used to run the native image generation process.Retrieved files are cached under subdirectory sources, using the module name (for JDK11) and package name of the associated class to define the directory hierarchy in which the source is located.For example, on Linux the source for class java.util.HashMap will be cached in file sources/java.base/java/util/HashMap.java.Debug info records for this class and its methods will identify this source file using the relative directory path java.base/java/util and file name HashMap.java. On Windows things will be the same modulo use of  rather than / as the file separator.Sources for GraalVM classes are retrieved from ZIP files or source directories derived from entries in the classpath.Retrieved files are cached under subdirectory sources, using the package name of the associated class to define the directory hierarchy in which the source is located (e.g., class com.oracle.svm.core.VM has its source file cached at sources/com/oracle/svm/core/VM.java).The lookup scheme for cached GraalVM sources varies depending upon what is found in each classpath entry.Given a JAR file entry like /path/to/foo.jar, the corresponding file /path/to/foo.src.zip is considered as a candidate ZIP file system from which source files may be extracted.When the entry specifies a directory like /path/to/bar, then directories /path/to/bar/src and /path/to/bar/src_gen are considered as candidates.Candidates are skipped when the ZIP file or source directory does not exist, or it does not contain at least one subdirectory hierarchy that matches one of the the expected GraalVM package hierarchies.Sources for application classes are retrieved from source JAR files or source directories derived from entries in the classpath.Retrieved files are cached under subdirectory sources, using the package name of the associated class to define the directory hierarchy in which the source is located (e.g., class org.my.foo.Foo has its source file cached as sources/org/my/foo/Foo.java).The lookup scheme for cached application sources varies depending upon what is found in each classpath entry.Given a JAR file entry like /path/to/foo.jar, the corresponding JAR /path/to/foo-sources.jar is considered as a candidate ZIP file system from which source files may be extracted.When the entry specifies a dir like /path/to/bar/classes or /path/to/bar/target/classes then one of the directories/path/to/bar/src/main/java, /path/to/bar/src/java or /path/to/bar/src is selected as a candidate (in that order of preference).Finally, the current directory in which the native executable is being run is also considered as a candidate.These lookup strategies are only provisional and may need extending in the future.However, it is possible to make missing sources available by other means.One option is to unzip extra app source JAR files, or copy extra app source trees into the cache.Another is to configure extra source search paths.Configuring Source Paths in GNU DebuggerBy default, GDB will employ the local directory root sources to locate the source files for your application classes, GraalVM classes, and JDK runtime classes.If the sources cache is not located in the directory in which you run GDB, you can configure the required paths using the following command:(gdb) set directories /path/to/sources/The argument to the set directories command should identify the location of the sources cache as an absolute path or a relative path from the working directory of the gdb session.Note that the current implementation does not yet find some sources for the GraalVM JIT compiler in the jdk.graal.compiler* package subspace.You can supplement the files cached in sources by unzipping application source JAR files or copying application source trees into the cache.You will need to ensure that any new subdirectory you add to sources corresponds to the top level package for the classes whose sources are being included.You can also add extra directories to the search path using the set directories command:(gdb) set directories /path/to/my/sources/:/path/to/my/other/sourcesNote that the GNU Debugger does not understand ZIP format file systems so any extra entries you add must identify a directory tree containing the relevant sources.Once again, top level entries in the directory added to the search path must correspond to the top level package for the classes whose sources are being included.Checking Debug Info on LinuxNote that this is only of interest to those who want to understand how the debug info implementation works or want to troubleshoot problems encountered during debugging that might relate to the debug info encoding.The objdump command can be used to display the debug info embedded into a native executable.The following commands (which all assume the target binary is called hello) can be used to display all generated content:objdump --dwarf=info hello &amp;gt; infoobjdump --dwarf=abbrev hello &amp;gt; abbrevobjdump --dwarf=ranges hello &amp;gt; rangesobjdump --dwarf=decodedline hello &amp;gt; decodedlineobjdump --dwarf=rawline hello &amp;gt; rawlineobjdump --dwarf=str hello &amp;gt; strobjdump --dwarf=loc hello &amp;gt; locobjdump --dwarf=frames hello &amp;gt; framesThe info section includes details of all compiled Java methods.The abbrev section defines the layout of records in the info section that describe Java files (compilation units) and methods.The ranges section details the start and end addresses of method code segments.The decodedline section maps subsegments of method code range segments to files and line numbers.This mapping includes entries for files and line numbers for inlined methods.The rawline segment provides details of how the line table is generated using DWARF state machine instructions that encode file, line, and address transitions.The loc section provides details of address ranges withinwhich parameter and local variables declared in the info sectionare known to have a determinate value. The details identify wherethe value is located, either in a machine register, on the stack orat a specific address in memory.The str section provides a lookup table for strings referenced from records in the info section.The frames section lists transition points in compiled methods where a (fixed size) stack frame is pushed or popped, allowing the debugger to identify each frame’s current and previous stack pointers and its return address.Note that some of the content embedded in the debug records is generated by the C compiler and belongs to code that is either in libraries or the C lib bootstrap code that is bundled in with the Java method code.Currently Supported TargetsThe prototype is currently implemented only for the GNU Debugger on Linux:      Linux/x86_64 support has been tested and should work correctly        Linux/AArch64 support is present but has not yet been fully verified (break points should work ok but stack backtraces may be incorrect)  Windows support is still under development.Debugging with IsolatesThe use of isolates in native image affects the way ordinary object pointers (oops) are encoded.In turn, that means the debug info generator has to provide gdb with information about how to translate an encoded oop to the address in memory, where the object data is stored.This sometimes requires care when asking gdb to process encoded oops vs decoded raw addresses.If isolates were disabled, oops would essentially be raw addresses pointing directly at the object contents.This is generally the same whether the oop is embedded in a static/instance field or is referenced from a local or parameter variable located in a register or saved to the stack.It is not quite that simple because the bottom 3 bits of some oops may be used to hold “tags” that record certain transient properties of an object.However, the debug info provided to gdb means that it will remove these tag bits before dereferencing the oop as an address.With the use of isolates, oops references stored in static or instance fields are actually relative addresses, offsets from a dedicated heap base register (r14 on x86_64, r29 on AArch64), rather than direct addresses (in a few special cases the offset may also have some low tag bits set).When an “indirect” oop of this kind gets loaded during execution, it is almost always immediately converted to a “raw” address by adding the offset to the heap base register value.So, oops which occur as the value of local or parameter vars are actually raw addresses.  Note that on some operating systems enabling isolates causes problems with printing of objects when using a gdb release version 10 or earlier. It is strongly recommended to upgrade your debugger to a later version.The DWARF info encoded into the image, when isolates are enabled, tells gdb to rebase indirect oops whenever it tries to dereference them to access underlying object data.This is normally automatic and transparent, but it is visible in the underlying type model that gdb displays when you ask for the type of objects.For example, consider the static field we encountered above.Printing its type in an image that uses isolates shows that this static field has a different type to the expected one:(gdb) ptype &#39;java.math.BigInteger&#39;::powerCachetype = class _z_.java.math.BigInteger[][] : public java.math.BigInteger[][] {} *The field is typed as _z_.java.math.BigInteger[][] which is an empty wrapper class that inherits from the expected type java.math.BigInteger[][].This wrapper type is essentially the same as the original but the DWARF info record that defines it includes information that tells gdb how to convert pointers to this type.When gdb is asked to print the oop stored in this field it is clear that it is an offset rather than a raw address.(gdb) p/x &#39;java.math.BigInteger&#39;::powerCache$1 = 0x286c08(gdb) x/x 0x286c080x286c08:Cannot access memory at address 0x286c08However, when gdb is asked to dereference through the field, it applies the necessary address conversion to the oop and fetches the correct data.(gdb) p/x *&#39;java.math.BigInteger&#39;::powerCache$2 = {  &amp;lt;java.math.BigInteger[][]&amp;gt; = {    &amp;lt;java.lang.Object&amp;gt; = {      &amp;lt;_objhdr&amp;gt; = {        hub = 0x1ec0e2,        idHash = 0x2f462321      }, &amp;lt;No data fields&amp;gt;},    members of java.math.BigInteger[][]:    len = 0x25,    data = 0x7ffff7a86c18  }, &amp;lt;No data fields&amp;gt;}Printing the type of the hub field or the data array shows that they are also modelled using indirect types:(gdb) ptype $1-&amp;gt;hubtype = class _z_.java.lang.Class : public java.lang.Class {} *(gdb) ptype $2-&amp;gt;datatype = class _z_.java.math.BigInteger[] : public java.math.BigInteger[] {} *[0]The debugger still knows how to dereference these oops:(gdb) p $1-&amp;gt;hub$3 = (_z_.java.lang.Class *) 0x1ec0e2(gdb) x/x $1-&amp;gt;hub0x1ec0e2:Cannot access memory at address 0x1ec0e2(gdb) p *$1-&amp;gt;hub$4 = {  &amp;lt;java.lang.Class&amp;gt;

We can build a native executable of the JShell’s UI part, and make it include Java on Truffle to run the code dynamically specified at run time.Prerequisites:  Latest GraalVM  Java on Truffle  Clone the project with the demo applications and navigate to the espresso-jshell directory:git clone https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-demos.gitcd graalvm-demos/espresso-jshellThe JShell implementation is actually the normal JShell launcher code, which only accepts Java on Truffle implementation (the project code-name is “Espresso”) of the execution engine.The “glue” code that binds the part which is AOT compiled with the component that dynamically evaluates the code is located in the EspressoExecutionControl class.It loads the JShell classes within the Java on Truffle context and delegate the input to them:    protected final Lazy&amp;lt;Value&amp;gt; ClassBytecodes = Lazy.of(() -&amp;gt; loadClass(&quot;jdk.jshell.spi.ExecutionControl$ClassBytecodes&quot;));    protected final Lazy&amp;lt;Value&amp;gt; byte_array = Lazy.of(() -&amp;gt; loadClass(&quot;[B&quot;));    protected final Lazy&amp;lt;Value&amp;gt; ExecutionControlException = Lazy.of(() -&amp;gt; loadClass(&quot;jdk.jshell.spi.ExecutionControl$ExecutionControlException&quot;));    protected final Lazy&amp;lt;Value&amp;gt; RunException = Lazy.of(() -&amp;gt; loadClass(&quot;jdk.jshell.spi.ExecutionControl$RunException&quot;));    protected final Lazy&amp;lt;Value&amp;gt; ClassInstallException = Lazy.of(() -&amp;gt; loadClass(&quot;jdk.jshell.spi.ExecutionControl$ClassInstallException&quot;));    protected final Lazy&amp;lt;Value&amp;gt; NotImplementedException = Lazy.of(() -&amp;gt; loadClass(&quot;jdk.jshell.spi.ExecutionControl$NotImplementedException&quot;));    protected final Lazy&amp;lt;Value&amp;gt; EngineTerminationException = Lazy.of(() -&amp;gt; loadClass(&quot;jdk.jshell.spi.ExecutionControl$EngineTerminationException&quot;));    protected final Lazy&amp;lt;Value&amp;gt; InternalException = Lazy.of(() -&amp;gt; loadClass(&quot;jdk.jshell.spi.ExecutionControl$InternalException&quot;));    protected final Lazy&amp;lt;Value&amp;gt; ResolutionException = Lazy.of(() -&amp;gt; loadClass(&quot;jdk.jshell.spi.ExecutionControl$ResolutionException&quot;));    protected final Lazy&amp;lt;Value&amp;gt; StoppedException = Lazy.of(() -&amp;gt; loadClass(&quot;jdk.jshell.spi.ExecutionControl$StoppedException&quot;));    protected final Lazy&amp;lt;Value&amp;gt; UserException = Lazy.of(() -&amp;gt; loadClass(&quot;jdk.jshell.spi.ExecutionControl$UserException&quot;));There is more code to pass the values correctly and transform the exceptions.To try it out, build the espresso-jshell binary using the provided script, which will:  Build the Java sources to the bytecode  Build the JAR file  Build a native executableAfter the build you can observe the resulting binary file (file and ldd are Linux commands)file ./espresso-jshellldd ./espresso-jshellIt is indeed a binary file not depending on the JVM, and you can run it noticing how fast it starts:./espresso-jshell|  Welcome to JShell -- Version 11.0.10|  For an introduction type: /help introjshell&amp;gt; 1 + 11 ==&amp;gt; 2Experiment with loading new code into JShell and see how Java on Truffle executes it.Watch a video version of the mixing AOT and JIT compiled code with Java on Truffle demo.                      watch video                            GraalVM Tools with Java on TruffleJava on Truffle is a proper part of the GraalVM ecosystem, and like other GraalVM-supported languages gets the support of developer tooling by default. The Truffle framework integrates with the tools like the debugger, profiler, memory analyser, the Instrumentation API.The interpreter for a language needs to mark the AST nodes with some annotations to support those tools.For example, to be able to use a profiler, a language interpreter needs to mark the root nodes.For the debugger purposes, the language expressions should be marked as instrumental, the scopes for the variables specified, and so on. The language interpreter does not need to integrate with the tools itself.As a result, you can profile a Java on Truffle program out of the box using either the CPU Sampler or Memory Tracer tools.For example, if we have a class like the following one computing the prime numbers:import java.util.List;import java.util.Random;import java.util.stream.Collectors;import java.util.stream.LongStream;public class Main {    public static void main(String[] args) {        Main m = new Main();        for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 100_000; i++) {            System.out.println(m.random(100));        }    }    private Random r = new Random(41);    public List&amp;lt;Long&amp;gt; random(int upperbound) {        int to = 2 + r.nextInt(upperbound - 2);        int from = 1 + r.nextInt(to - 1);        return primeSequence(from, to);    }    public static List&amp;lt;Long&amp;gt; primeSequence(long min, long max) {        return LongStream.range(min, max)                .filter(Main::isPrime)                .boxed()                .collect(Collectors.toList());    }    public static boolean isPrime(long n) {        return LongStream.rangeClosed(2, (long) Math.sqrt(n))                .allMatch(i -&amp;gt; n % i != 0);    }}Build this program, and run it with the --cpusampler option.javac Main.javajava -truffle --cpusampler Main &amp;gt; output.txtAt the end of the output.txt file you will find the profiler output, the histogram of the methods, and how much time the execution took.You can also try an experiment with the --memtracer option, to see where the allocations in this program are happening.java -truffle --experimental-options --memtracer Main &amp;gt; output.txtOther tools that GraalVM offers are Chrome Debugger, Code Coverage, and GraalVM Insight.Having the “out-of-the-box” support for the developer tooling makes Java on Truffle an interesting choice of the JVM.Watch a short demonstration of GraalVM built-in tools for Java on Truffle.                      watch video                            ",

For example:@ExportLibrary(InteropLibrary.class)public class BasicObject extends DynamicObject implements TruffleObject {    public BasicObject(Shape shape) {        super(shape);    }    @ExportMessage    boolean hasLanguage() {        return true;    }    // ...}It makes sense to also export common InteropLibrary messages in this class.Builtin object classes can then extend this base class and export additional messages, and, as usual, extra Java fields and methods:@ExportLibrary(InteropLibrary.class)public class Array extends BasicObject {    private final Object[] elements;    public Array(Shape shape, Object[] elements) {        super(shape);        this.elements = elements;    }    @ExportMessage    boolean hasArrayElements() {        return true;    }    @ExportMessage    long getArraySize() {        return elements.length;    }    // ...}Dynamic object members can be accessed using the DynamicObjectLibrary, which can be obtained using the @CachedLibrary annotation of the Truffle DSL and DynamicObjectLibrary.getFactory() + getUncached(), create(DynamicObject), and createDispatched(int).Here is an example of how it could be used to implement InteropLibrary messages:@ExportLibrary(InteropLibrary.class)public class SimpleObject extends BasicObject {    public UserObject(Shape shape) {        super(shape);    }    @ExportMessage    boolean hasMembers() {        return true;    }    @ExportMessage    Object readMember(String name,                    @CachedLibrary(&quot;this&quot;) DynamicObjectLibrary objectLibrary)                    throws UnknownIdentifierException {        Object result = objectLibrary.getOrDefault(this, name, null);        if (result == null) {            /* Property does not exist. */            throw UnknownIdentifierException.create(name);        }        return result;    }    @ExportMessage    void writeMember(String name, Object value,                    @CachedLibrary(&quot;this&quot;) DynamicObjectLibrary objectLibrary) {        objectLibrary.put(this, name, value);    }    @ExportMessage    boolean isMemberReadable(String member,                    @CachedLibrary(&quot;this&quot;) DynamicObjectLibrary objectLibrary) {        return objectLibrary.containsKey(this, member);    }    // ...}In order to construct instances of these objects, you first need a Shape that you can pass to the DynamicObject constructor.This shape is created using Shape.newBuilder().build().The returned shape describes the initial shape of the object and forms the root of a new shape tree.As you are adding new properties with DynamicObjectLibrary#put, the object will mutate into other shapes in this shape tree.Note: You should reuse the same initial shapes because shapes are internally cached per root shape.It is recommended that you store the initial shapes in the TruffleLanguage instance, so they can be shared across contexts of the same engine.Static shapes should be avoided except for singletons (like a null value).For example:@TruffleLanguage.Registration(...)public final class MyLanguage extends TruffleLanguage&amp;lt;MyContext&amp;gt; {    private final Shape initialObjectShape;    private final Shape initialArrayShape;    public MyLanguage() {        this.initialObjectShape = Shape.newBuilder(ExtendedObject.class).build();        this.initialArrayShape = Shape.newBuilder().build();    }    public createObject() {        return new MyObject(initialObjectShape);    }    //...}Extended Object LayoutYou can extend the default object layout with extra dynamic fields that you hand over to the dynamic object model by adding @DynamicField-annotated field declarations of type Object or long in your subclasses, and specifying the layout class with Shape.newBuilder().layout(ExtendedObject.class).build();.Dynamic fields declared in this class and its superclasses will then automatically be used to store dynamic object properties and allow faster access to properties that fit into this reserved space.Note: You must not access dynamic fields directly. Always use DynamicObjectLibrary for this purpose.@ExportLibrary(InteropLibrary.class)public class ExtendedObject extends SimpleObject {    @DynamicField private Object _obj0;    @DynamicField private Object _obj1;    @DynamicField private Object _obj2;    @DynamicField private long _long0;    @DynamicField private long _long1;    @DynamicField private long _long2;    public ExtendedObject(Shape shape) {        super(shape);    }}Caching ConsiderationsIn order to ensure optimal caching, avoid reusing the same cached DynamicObjectLibrary for multiple, independent operations (get, put, etc.).Try to minimize the number of different shapes and property keys seen by each cached library instance.When the property keys are known statically (compilation-final), always use a separate DynamicObjectLibrary for each property key.Use dispatched libraries (@CachedLibrary(limit=...)) when putting multiple properties in succession.For example:public abstract class MakePairNode extends BinaryExpressionNode {    @Specialization    Object makePair(Object left, Object right,                    @CachedLanguage MyLanguage language,                    @CachedLibrary(limit = &quot;3&quot;) putLeft,                    @CachedLibrary(limit = &quot;3&quot;) putRight) {        MyObject obj = language.createObject();        putLeft.put(obj, &quot;left&quot;, left);        putRight.put(obj, &quot;right&quot;, right);        return obj;    }}Further ReadingA high-level description of the object model has been published in An Object Storage Model for the Truffle Language Implementation Framework.See Truffle publications for more presentations and publications about Truffle and GraalVM.",

          "content": "Dynamic Proxy in Native ImageJava dynamic proxies, implemented by java.lang.reflect.Proxy, provide a mechanism which enables object level access control by routing all method invocations through java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler.Dynamic proxy classes are generated from a list of interfaces.Native Image does not provide machinery for generating and interpreting bytecode at run time.Therefore all dynamic proxy classes need to be generated at image build time.Automatic DetectionNative Image employs a simple static analysis that detects calls to java.lang.reflect.Proxy.newProxyInstance(ClassLoader, Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[], InvocationHandler) and java.lang.reflect.Proxy.getProxyClass(ClassLoader, Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[]), then tries to determine the list of interfaces that define dynamic proxies automatically.Given the list of interfaces, Native Image generates proxy classes at image build time and adds them to the native image heap.In addition to generating the dynamic proxy class, the constructor of the generated class that takes a java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler argument, i.e., the one reflectively invoked by java.lang.reflect.Proxy.newProxyInstance(ClassLoader, Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[], InvocationHandler), is registered for reflection so that dynamic proxy instances can be allocated at run time.The analysis is limited to situations where the list of interfaces comes from a constant array or an array that is allocated in the same method.For example, in the code snippets bellow the dynamic proxy interfaces can be determined automatically.Static Final Array:class ProxyFactory {    private static final Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] interfaces = new Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[]{java.util.Comparator.class};    static Comparator createProxyInstanceFromConstantArray() {        ClassLoader classLoader = ProxyFactory.class.getClassLoader();        InvocationHandler handler = new ProxyInvocationHandler();        return (Comparator) Proxy.newProxyInstance(classLoader, interfaces, handler);    }}Note that the analysis operates on compiler graphs and not source code.Therefore the following ways to declare and populate an array are equivalent from the point of view of the analysis:private static final Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] interfacesArrayPreInitialized = new Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[]{java.util.Comparator.class};private static final Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] interfacesArrayLiteral = {java.util.Comparator.class};private static final Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] interfacesArrayPostInitialized = new Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[1];static {    interfacesArrayPostInitialized[0] = java.util.Comparator.class;}However, there are no immutable arrays in Java.Even if the array is declared as static final, its contents can change later on.The simple analysis employed here does not track further changes to the array.New Array:class ProxyFactory {    static Comparator createProxyInstanceFromNewArray() {        ClassLoader classLoader = ProxyFactory.class.getClassLoader();        InvocationHandler handler = new ProxyInvocationHandler();        Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] interfaces = new Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[]{java.util.Comparator.class};        return (Comparator) Proxy.newProxyInstance(classLoader, interfaces, handler);    }}Note: Just like with constant arrays, the following ways to declare and populate an array are equivalent from the point of view of the analysis:Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] interfaces = new Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[]{java.util.Comparator.class};Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] interfaces = new Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[1];interfaces[0] = Question.class;Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] interfaces = {java.util.Comparator.class};The static analysis covers code patterns most frequently used to define dynamic proxy classes.For the exceptional cases where the analysis cannot discover the interface array there is also a manual dynamic proxy configuration mechanism.Related Documentation  Configure Dynamic Proxies Manually  Reachability Metadata: Dynamic Proxy",

          "content": "Permissions for Python EmbeddingsAccess Control and Security Limits for Python ScriptsEmbedding GraalPy into Java works with the GraalVM Polyglot Sandbox.Python’s POSIX InterfaceThe way the operating system interface is exposed to Python scripts is GraalPy-specific.By default all access is routed through Java interfaces, but some packages rely on details of POSIX APIs and require direct native access.Graal languages (those implemented on the Truffle framework) usually implement system-related functions using the Truffle abstraction layer, which is OS independent and provides extension points for the users when embedding GraalPy or other Graal languages into Java applications.See, for example, the Truffle FileSystem service-provider.The standard Python library also provides an OS abstraction, but exposes lower level interfaces. For example, the os module directly exposes some POSIX functions.On non-POSIX platforms, this interface is emulated to a degree.GraalPy provides two alternative implementations (each referred to as a “backend”) of system-related functionality offered by built-in Python modules such as os.The PosixModuleBackend option determines which backend is used: valid values are native and java.Native BackendThis backend directly calls the POSIX API in mostly the same way as CPython (the reference Python implementation).This approach is the most compatible with CPython and provides bare access to the underlying OS interface without an intermediate  emulation layer.By default, this implementation bypasses the Truffle abstraction layer, and therefore it is not sandboxed and does not support custom implementations of Truffle FileSystem service-provider, and other Polyglot API providers related to system interfaces.The native backend is chosen by default when GraalPy is started via the graalpy or any other Python related launcher.The exceptions are Python related launchers with -managed suffix available only in Oracle GraalVM (for example, graalpy-managed), which by default use the java POSIX backend.Limitations of the Native BackendKnown limitations are:  os.fork is not supported  _posixsubprocess.fork_exec does not support the preexec_fn parameterJava BackendThis backend uses the Truffle abstraction layer and therefore supports custom Polyglot API providers related to system interfaces and sandboxing.Because this abstraction is POSIX agnostic, it does not expose all the necessary functionality. Some functionality is emulated, and some functionality is unsupported.The Java backend is the default when GraalPy is run via the Context API, that is, embedded in Java applications, or when it is launched using Python-related launchers with the -managed suffix (available only in Oracle GraalVM).Limitations of the Java BackendGraalPy can log information about known incompatibility of functions executed at runtime, which includes the OS interface-related functions.To turn on this logging, use the command-line option --log.python.compatibility.level=FINE (or other desired logging level).Known limitations of the of the Java backend are:  Its state is disconnected from the actual OS state, which applies especially to:          file descriptors: Python-level file descriptors are not usable in native code.      current working directory: is initialized to the current workingdirectory at the startup, but is then maintained separately. So, for example, chdir in Pythondoes not change the actual current working directory of the process.      umask: has the same limitation as that of the current working directory, but it is always initializedto 0022 regardless of the actual system value at startup.        Resolution of file access/modification times depends on the JDK.The best the Java backend can guarantee is seconds resolution.  os.access and any other functionality based on faccessat POSIX function does not support:          effective IDs.      follow_symlinks=False unless the mode is only F_OK.

          "title": "Context Exit",
          "content": "Context ExitDifferent Truffle (guest) languages may use different mechanisms for exiting. This is not optimal as a Truffle language has no way to detect and handle an exit triggered by a different language.As of 22.0 Truffle has support for polyglot context hard explicit exit triggered by guest languages using TruffleContext.closeExited(Node,int).It provides a unified way for languages to trigger the exit of the underlying polyglot context. When triggered, all initializedguest languages are first notified using TruffleLanguage.exitContext(C,ExitMode,int), then all context threads are stopped, and finally, the context is closed.The hard explicit exit is simply referred to as “hard exit”.The hard exit is only one of the three types of exit in Truffle. There are the following types of exit.  The new hard exit introduced above          Hard exit notifications are executed with ExitMode.HARD as the second parameter of TruffleLanguage.exitContext(C,ExitMode,int).        Implicit “natural exit”          Occurs during normal context close.      The newly introduced exit notifications are executed for the natural exit as well, but threads are not forced to stop after the natural exit notifications, and so context threads that are still running can block the natural exit.      Natural exit notifications are executed with ExitMode.NATURAL as the second parameter of TruffleLanguage.exitContext(C,ExitMode,int).        “Soft exit”          Explicit exit triggered by throwing a Truffle exception of the exception type ExceptionType.EXIT.      The exception is not automatically thrown in other threads by Truffle and it does not trigger exit notifications or context close on its own.      The context is still fully usable after a soft exit and the soft exit can be followed by either the natural or the hard exit.      For completeness, a polyglot context can be also closed by cancelling it using Context.close(true), TruffleContext.closeCancelled(Node,String), or TruffleContext.closeResourceExhausted(Node,String).The cancel operation leads to immediate stopping of all context threads and closing the context without any exit notifications.Soft exitThe soft exit is triggered by throwing a Truffle exception of the exception type ExceptionType.EXIT - soft exit exception. The exception is not automatically thrown in other threads by Truffle and it does not trigger exit notifications or context close on its own.If not caught by languages, the soft exit exception eventually causes the embedder thread to throw a PolyglotException to the host with PolyglotException.isExit() == true and PolyglotException.getExitStatus() equal to the value specified by the soft exit exception.The context is still fully usable after a soft exit, but the embedder should close the context when it sees the PolyglotException with PolyglotException.isExit() == true, in which case the soft exit is followed by the natural exit.Natural ExitThe natural exit occurs during a normal context close triggered by Context.close() or TruffleContext.close(). The natural exit illustrated in the figure above consists of the following steps:      The natural exit is triggered by Context.close() or TruffleContext.close().    Exit notifications for all initialized languages are executed - TruffleLanguage.exitContext(C,ExitMode,int), where ExitMode.NATURAL is used as the ExitMode parameter.          Guest code runs normally during exit notifications.        All initialized languages are finalized.          TruffleLanguage.finalizeContext(C) is called for all initalized languages.      Guest code runs normally during finalization.        All languages are disposed.          TruffleLanguage.disposeContext(C) is called for all languages.      Hard ExitThis section describes the hard exit process in detail. The hard exit for a polyglot context can be customized by Context.Builder.useSystemExit(boolean). Therefore,the following description is divided into two subsections. One for the case whensystem exit is not enabled (Context.Builder.useSystemExit(false) - the default) and one for the case when system exitis enabled (Context.Builder#useSystemExit(true)). The illustration of the exit process is depicted in the figure above. The figure also relates the exit process to the context cancelling process.The red color of some of the boxes indicates that the context is invalid at that point and no guest code can be run. More precisely, the first Truffle safepoint will throw either a special ThreadDeath exit exception ora special ThreadDeath cancel exception depending on whether the hard exit or the cancel operation is in progress.Behavior if useSystemExit is disabled (default)      The exit is triggered by TruffleContext.closeExited(Node,int).    Exit notifications for all initialized languages are executed - TruffleLanguage.exitContext(C,ExitMode,int), where ExitMode.HARD is used as the ExitMode parameter.          Guest code runs normally during exit notifications.      If the context is not cancelled during exit notifications (during step 2a) and reaches step 2b, the exit process proceeds with the next step. Otherwise, the exit notifications are interrupted and the context is immediately cancelled.        All context threads are forced to stop by throwing a special ThreadDeath exit exception from Truffle safepoints.          To exit threads reliably, languages need to ensure that ThreadDeath is always immediately rethrown and guest language exception handlers and finally blocks are not run.      The embedder threads eventually throw a PolyglotException to the host with PolyglotException.isExit() == true and PolyglotException.getExitStatus()being equal to the exit code originally specified as the second parameter to the first call toTruffleContext.closeExited(Node,int).      Note that from step 3 the exit process is similar to the cancelling process as indicated by the figure, but the cancelling process uses a special ThreadDeath cancel exceptionand the PolyglotException thrown to the host has PolyglotException.isCancelled() == true instead of PolyglotException.isExit() == true.        All initialized languages are finalized.          TruffleLanguage.finalizeContext(C) is called for all initalized languages.      Running any guest code in TruffleLanguage.finalizeContext(C) will throw the special ThreadDeath exit exception from the first Truffle safepoint.      Languages should skip any finalization that would require running guest code. A language can find out if it can run guest code in TruffleLanguage.finalizeContext(C) by checking if TruffleLanguage.exitContext(C,ExitMode,int) was previously called with ExitMode.NATURAL,or by checking that TruffleContext.isClosed() returns false.        All languages are disposed.          TruffleLanguage.disposeContext(C) is called for all languages.        The context is closed.Behavior if useSystemExit is enabled  The exit is triggered by TruffleContext.closeExited(Node,int).          Same as with system exit disabled.        Exit notifications for all initialized languages are executed - TruffleLanguage.exitContext(C,ExitMode,int), where ExitMode.HARD is used as the ExitMode parameter.          Same as with system exit disabled.        System.exit(int) is called to terminate the whole host application providing the fastest exit possible.          The exit code passed to System.exit(int)is the one originally specified as the second parameter to the first call toTruffleContext.closeExited(Node,int).      Example UsageThe SimpleLanguage demonstrates the usage of the hard context exit. The following aspects are demonstrated.  SLExitBuiltin demonstrates triggering the context exit.  SLRegisterShutdownHookBuiltin demonstrates registration of shutdown hooks that are executed during the exit notification defined in SLLanguage.  SLExitTest demonstrates the usage of the builtins defined above.",

          "title": "Experimental Agent Options",
          "content": "Experimental Agent OptionsThe native-image-agent tool has options which are currently experimental and might be enabled in future releases, but can also be changed or removed entirely.These options are described here.Support For Predefined ClassesNative-image needs all classes to be known at image build time (a “closed-world assumption”).However, Java has support for loading new classes at runtime.To emulate class loading, the agent can be told to trace dynamically loaded classes and save their bytecode for later use by the image builder.This functionality can be enabled by adding experimental-class-define-support to the agent option string, e.g.: -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=config,experimental-class-define-supportApart from the standard configuration files, the agent will create an agent-extracted-predefined-classes directory in the configuration output directory and write bytecode of newly loaded classes on the go.The configuration directory can then be used by image builder without additional tweaks,.The classes will be loaded during the image build, but will not be initialized or made available to the application.At runtime, if there is an attempt to load a class with the same name and bytecodes as one of the classes encountered during tracing, the predefined class will be supplied to the application.Known Limitations  Native images support “loading” a predefined class only once per execution, by just a single class loader.  Predefined classes are initialized when they are “loaded” at runtime and cannot be initialized at build time.  The agent collects all classes which are not loaded by one of the Java VM’s built-in class loaders (with some exceptions), that is, from the class path or module path. This includes classes loaded by any custom class loaders.  Classes that are generated with varying data in their name or bytecodes, such as sequential or random numbers or timestamps, can generally not be matched to predefined classes at runtime. In these cases, the way such classes are generated needs to be adjusted.Printing Configuration With OriginsFor debugging, it may be useful to know the origin of certain configuration entries.By supplying experimental-configuration-with-origins to the agent option string, the agent will output configuration files with configuration entries broken down to the calling context (stack trace) they originate from in tree form.This option should be used in conjunction with config-output-dir=&amp;lt;path&amp;gt; to tell the agent where to output the configuration files.An example agent option string: -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=config-with-origins/,experimental-configuration-with-originsOmitting Configuration From The Agent’s OutputThe agent can omit traced configuration entries present in existing configuration files.There are two ways to specify these existing configuration files:  By using configuration files from the class path or module path. When experimental-omit-config-from-classpath is added to the agent option string, the class path and module path of the running application are scanned for META-INF/native-image/**/*.json configuration files.  By explicitly pointing the agent to an existing configuration file directory using config-to-omit=&amp;lt;path&amp;gt;.Generating Conditional Configuration Using the AgentThe agent can, using a heuristic, generate configuration with reachability conditions on user specified classes.The agent will track configuration origins and try to deduce the conditions automatically.User classes are specified via an agent filter file (for more information on the format, see more about the agent).Additionally, the resulting configuration can further be filtered using another filter file.Currently, this feature supports two modes:  Generating conditional configuration in a single run with the agent.  Generating conditional configuration from multiple runs with the agent and finally merging the collected data.Generating Conditional Configuration During an Agent RunTo enable this mode, add experimental-conditional-config-filter-file=&amp;lt;path&amp;gt; to the agent’s command line, where &amp;lt;path&amp;gt; points to an agent filter file.Classes that are considered included by this filter will be designated as user code classes.To further filter the generated configuration, you can use conditional-config-class-filter-file=&amp;lt;path&amp;gt;, where &amp;lt;path&amp;gt; is a path to an agent filter file.Generating Conditional Configuration From Multiple Agent RunsConditional configuration can be generated from multiple agent runs that reach different code paths in the application.Each agent run produces configuration with metadata. native-image-configure is then used to merge the collected data and produce a conditional configuration.To run the agent in this mode, add experimental-conditional-config-part to the agent’s command line.Once all the agent runs have finished, you can generate a conditional configuration by invoking:native-image-configure generate-conditional --user-code-filter=&amp;lt;path-to-filter-file&amp;gt; --class-name-filter=&amp;lt;path-to-filter-file&amp;gt; --input-dir=&amp;lt;path-to-agent-run-output-1&amp;gt; --input-dir=&amp;lt;path-to-agent-run-ouput-2&amp;gt; ... --output-dir=&amp;lt;path-to-resulting-conditional-config&amp;gt;where:  --user-code-filter=&amp;lt;path-to-filter-file&amp;gt;: path to an agent filter file that specifies user classes  (optional) --class-name-filter=&amp;lt;path-to-filter-file&amp;gt;: path to an agent filter file that further filters the generated configThe Underlying HeuristicsConditions are generated using the call tree of the application. The heuristics work as follows:  For each unique method, create a list of all nodes in the call tree that correspond to the method  For each unique method, if the method has more than one call node in the tree:          Find common configuration across all call nodes of that method      For each call node of the method, propagate configuration that isn’t common across these calls to the caller node        Repeat 2. until an iteration produced no changes in the call tree.  For each node that contains configuration, generate a conditional configuration entry with the method’s class as the condition.The primary goal of this heuristic is to attempt to find where a method creates different configuration entries depending on the caller (for example, a method that wraps Class.forName calls.)This implies that the heuristic will not work well for code that generates configuration through a different dependency (for example, same method returns calls Class.forName with different class parameters depending on a system property).Further Reading  Reachability Metadata  Metadata Collection with the Tracing Agent",

          "content": "R Extensions SupportThe GraalVM R runtime can run R extensions in two modes:  native: the native machine code is run directly on your CPU, the same way GNU R runs R extensions.  llvm: if the LLVM bitcode is available, it can be interpreted by the LLVM interpreter shipped with GraalVM.The native mode is better suited for code that does not extensively interact with the R API, for example, plain C or Fortran numerical computations working on primitive arrays.The llvm mode provides significantly better performance for extensions that frequently call between R and the C/C++ code, because GraalVM’s LLVM runtime is also partially evaluated like the R code.Both can be inlined and optimized as one compilation unit.Moreover, GraalVM’s LLVM runtime is supported by GraalVM tools which allows users to, for instance, debug R and C code together.In one GraalVM R process, any R package can be loaded in either mode.That is, GraalVM’s R runtime supports mixing packages loaded in the native mode with packages loaded in the llvm mode in one process.Generating LLVM BitcodeAs of version 19.3.0, the GraalVM R runtime is configured to use the LLVM toolchain to compile R packages’ native code.This toolchain produces standard executable binaries for a given system, but it also embeds the corresponding LLVM bitcode into them.The binaries produced by the LLVM toolchain can be loaded in both modes: native or llvm.The GraalVM R runtime can be reconfigured to use your system default compilers when installing R packages by running:# use local installation of GGC:R -e &#39;fastr.setToolchain(&quot;native&quot;)&#39;# to revert back to using the GraalVM&#39;s LLVM toolchain:R -e &#39;fastr.setToolchain(&quot;llvm&quot;)&#39;Using the system default compilers may be more reliable, but you lose the ability to load the R packages built with the LLVM toolchain in the llvm mode, because they will not contain the embedded bitcode.Moreover, mixing packages built by the local system default compilers and packages built by the LLVM toolchain in one R process may cause linking issues.Fortran CompilerAs of version 20.1.0, the GraalVM R runtime uses gfortran as the default Fortran compiler when installing R packages.Since gfortran cannot produce bitcode, packages that contain Fortran code will not work in the llvm mode.The GraalVM R runtime contains the F2C tool, which can convert Fortran code to C and then compile it with the LLVM toolchain.Users can configure GraalVM’s R runtime to use this tool by editing the configuration file R_HOME/etc/Makeconf, variable FC.Choosing the Running ModeStarting with version 19.3.0, GraalVM’s R runtime uses the following defaults:  native mode to load the packages  llvm toolchain to build their sourcesTo enable the llvm mode for loading the packages, use --R.BackEnd=llvm.You can also enable each mode selectively for the given R packages by using:  --R.BackEndLLVM=package1,package2  --R.BackEndNative=package1,package2Moreover, you can configure which packages will be always run in the native mode in file R_HOME/etc/native-packages. GraalVM’s R runtime comes with a default configuration that covers some popular R packages that are known to not work yet in the llvm mode.",

          "content": "Frequently Asked QuestionsDoes Java running on Truffle implement the Java language running as a Truffle interpreter?Not quite: it implements the Java Virtual Machine running as a Truffle interpreter.That means it can only run a Java program once it has been compiled to Java bytecode (classes, JARs, etc.) with your favorite Java compiler (e.g., javac) or a build tool (Maven, Gradle, etc.).In the GraalVM family, this is similar to WebAssembly or the LLVM interpreter: while both can run C programs, they have to be complied by a C compiler first.Does Java running on Truffle run on HotSpot too?Like other languages implemented with the Truffle framework, it can run both as a native executable or on top of HotSpot.Running on top of HotSpot is currently only possible on Linux.We plan to extend this capability to macOS and Windows platforms also.Does running Java on Truffle require HotSpot?No, it doesn’t, it works fine as a native executable.Java on Truffle does require a standard core Java library (the rt.jar library for Java 8 or the lib/modules file for Java 11 and Java 17 as well as the associated native libraries: libjava, libnio, etc.)Running Java on GraalVM already brings the highest level of optimization, what benefits will Java on Truffle give me?  Java on Truffle will inherit the extensive tooling provided by the Truffle framework. This means that for the things like code coverage and profiling you would no longer need to rely on external tools.  Another important aspect is that Java on Truffle comes with improved isolation of the host Java VM and the Java program running on Truffle.  Moreover, Java on Truffle can run in the context of a native executable while still allowing dynamically-loaded bytecodes!  Finally, you can enjoy the benefits of enhanced HotSwap capabilities which will help boost your productivity.What is the license for Java on Truffle?Java on Truffle is an implementation of the Java Virtual Machine. It is open source and is offered as free software under the GNU General Public License version two (GPLv2).Can I run Java on Truffle in production?Yes, you can. Java on Truffle is still a prototype, but it already passes the Java Compatibility Kit (JCK or TCK for Java SE) 8, 11 and 17 runtimes.It may undergo significant improvements.What performance can I expect from executing Java on Truffle?Performance is currently 2-3x slower than HotSpot.It does not match the speed offered by GraalVM yet for sure, but having created a fully working Java on Truffle runtime, the development team is now focusing on making it as performant as the GraalVM JIT.Can I embed Java running on Truffle in my application?Yes, you can use GraalVM’s Polyglot API to run Java bytecodes in a separate context from the host Java VM.You can even embed a Java 8 context in a Java 11 or Java 17 application!Why do I see “Unrecognized option: -javaagent:…/idea_rt.jar…” when I try to run my app from the IDE?Java on Truffle does not yet support attaching Java agents. For the time being add: -XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions to the VM options too.",

          "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
          "content": "Frequently Asked QuestionsBelow are the most frequently asked questions and answers about JavaScript running on GraalVM.CompatibilityIs GraalVM compatible with the JavaScript language?GraalVM is compatible with the ECMAScript 2023 specification and is further developed alongside the 2024 draft specification.The compatibility of GraalVM’s JavaScript runtime is verified by external sources, like the Kangax ECMAScript compatibility table.GraalVM JavaScript is tested against a set of test engines, like the official test suite of ECMAScript, test262, as well as tests published by V8 and Nashorn, Node.js unit tests, and GraalVM’s own unit tests.For a reference of the JavaScript APIs that GraalVM supports, see GRAAL.JS-API.Is GraalVM compatible with the original node implementation?Node.js based on GraalVM is largely compatible with the original Node.js (based on the V8 engine).This leads to a high number of npm-based modules being compatible with GraalVM.In fact, out of the 100k npm modules we test, more than 94% of them pass all tests.Still, several sources of differences have to be considered:  Setup:GraalVM mostly mimicks the original setup of Node, including the node executable, npm, and similar.However, not all command-line options are supported (or behave exactly identically).Modules might require that native modules are (re-)compiled against the v8.h file.Since GraalVM 21.1, Node.js and all related executables (e.g., node, npm, etc.) are not included by default in the GraalVM binary.Node.js support is now packaged in a separate component that can be installed with the GraalVM Updater using $JAVA_HOME/bin/gu install nodejs.      Internals:GraalVM is implemented on top of a JVM, and thus has a different internal architecture than Node.js based on V8.This implies that some internal mechanisms behave differently and cannot exactly replicate V8 behaviour.This will hardly ever affect user code, but might affect modules implemented natively, depending on V8 internals.        Performance:Due to GraalVM being implemented on top of a JVM, performance characteristics vary from the original native implementation.While GraalVM’s peak performance can match V8 on many benchmarks, it will typically take longer to reach the peak (known as warmup).Be sure to give the GraalVM compiler some extra time when measuring (peak) performance.        Compatiblity:GraalVM uses the following approaches to check and retain compatibility with Node.js code:    node-compat-table: GraalVM is compared against other engines using the node-compat-table module, highlighting incompatibilities that might break Node.js code.  automated mass-testing of modules using mocha: in order to test a large set of modules, GraalVM is tested against 95k modules that use the mocha test framework. Using mocha allows automating the process of executing the test and comprehending the test result.  manual testing of popular modules: a select list of npm modules is tested in a manual test setup. These highly-relevant modules are tested in a more sophisticated manner.My application used to run on Nashorn, it does not work on GraalVM JavaScript?Reason:  GraalVM JavaScript tries to be compatible with the ECMAScript specification, as well as competing engines (including Nashorn). In some cases, this is a contradicting requirement; then, ECMAScript is given precedence. Also, there are cases where GraalVM Javascript is not exactly replicating Nashorn features intentionally, e.g., for security reasons.Solution:  In many cases, enabling GraalVM’s Nashorn compatibility mode enables features not enabled by default. Note that this can have negative effects on application security! See the Nashorn Migration Guide for details.Specific applications:  For JSR 223 ScriptEngine, you might want to set the system property polyglot.js.nashorn-compat to true in order to use the Nashorn compatibility mode.  For ant, use ANT_OPTS=&quot;-Dpolyglot.js.nashorn-compat=true&quot; ant when using GraalVM JavaScript via ScriptEngine.Builtin functions like array.map() or fn.apply() are not available on non-JavaScript objects like ProxyArrays from JavaReason:  Java objects provided to JavaScript are treated as close as possible to their JavaScript counterpart. For instance, Java arrays provided to JavaScript are treated like JavaScript Array exotic objects (JavaScript arrays) whenever possible; the same is true for functions. One obvious difference is that such object’s prototype is null. This means that while you can, e.g., read the length or read and write the values of a Java array in JavaScript code, you cannot call sort() on it, as the Array.prototype is not provided by default.Solution:  While the objects do not have the methods of the prototype assigned, you can explicitly call them, e.g., Array.prototype.call.sort(myArray).  We offer the option js.foreign-object-prototype. When enabled, objects on the JavaScript side get the most prototype (e.g. Array.prototype, Function.prototype, Object.prototype) set and can thus behave more similarly to native JavaScript objects of the respective type. Normal JavaScript precedence rules apply here, e.g., own properties (of the Java object in that case) take precedence over and hide properties from the prototype.Note that while the JavaScript builtin functions. e.g., from Array.prototype can be called on the respective Java types, those functions expect JavaScript semantics.This for instance means that operations might fail (typically with a TypeError: Message not supported) when an operation is not supported in Java.Consider Array.prototype.push as an example: while arrays can grow in size in JavaScript, they are fixed-size in Java, thus pushing a value is semantically not possible and will fail.In such cases, you can wrap the Java object and handle that case explicitly.Use the interfaces ProxyObject and ProxyArray for that purpose.How can one verify GraalVM works on their application?If your module ships with tests, execute them with GraalVM. Of course, this will only test your application, but not its dependencies.You can use the Compatibility tool to find whether the module you are interested in is tested on GraalVM, and whether the tests pass successfully.Additionally, you can upload your package-lock.json or package.json file into that tool and it will analyze all your dependencies at once.PerformanceMy application is slower on GraalVM JavaScript than on another engineReason:  Ensure your benchmark considers warmup. During the first few iterations, GraalVM JavaScript may be slower than other engines, but after sufficient warmup, this difference should level out.  GraalVM JavaScript is shipped in two different standalones: Native (default) and JVM (with a -jvm infix). While the default Native mode offers faster startup and lower latency, it might exhibit slower peak performance (lower throughput) once the application is warmed up. In the JVM mode, the application might need hundreds of milliseconds more to start, but typically shows better peak performance.  Repeated execution of code via newly created org.graalvm.polyglot.Context is slow, despite the same code being executed every time.Solution:  Use proper warmup in your benchmark, and disregard the first few iterations where the application still warms up.  When embedding GraalVM JavaScript in a Java application, ensure you’re running on a GraalVM JDK for best performance.  Use -jvm standalones for slower startup, but higher peak performance.  Double-check you have no flags set that might lower your performance, e.g., -ea/-esa.  When running code via org.graalvm.polyglot.Context, make sure that one org.graalvm.polyglot.Engine object is shared and passed to each newly created Context. Use org.graalvm.polyglot.Source objects and cache them when possible. Then, GraalVM makes sure already compiled code can be shared across the Contexts, leading to improved performance. See Reference Manual: Code Caching across multiple Contexts for more details and an example.  Try to minify the problem to the root cause and file an issue so the GraalVM team can have a look.How to achieve the best peak performance?Here are a few tips you can follow to analyse and improve peak performance:  When measuring, ensure you have given the GraalVM compiler enough time to compile all hot methods before starting to measure peak performance. A useful command line option for that is --engine.TraceCompilation=true – this outputs a message whenever a (JavaScript) method is compiled. As long as this still prints frequently, measurement should not yet start.  Compare the performance between Native Image and the JVM mode if possible. Depending on the characteristics of your application, one or the other might show better peak performance.  The Polyglot API comes with several tools and options to inspect the performance of your application:          --cpusampler and --cputracer will print a list of the hottest methods when the application is terminated. Use that list to figure out where most time is spent in your application.      --experimental-options --memtracer can help you understand the memory allocations of your application. Refer to the Profiling Command Line Tool reference for more detail.      What is the difference between running GraalVM’s JavaScript in Native Image compared to the JVM?In essence, the JavaScript engine of GraalVM is a plain Java application.Running it on any JVM (JDK 21 or later) is possible, but, for a better result, it should be GraalVM JDK, or a compatible Oracle JDK or OpenJDK using the Graal Compiler.This mode gives the JavaScript engine full access to Java at runtime, but also requires the JVM to first (just-in-time) compile the JavaScript engine when executed, just like any other Java application.Running in Native Image means that the JavaScript engine, including all its dependencies from, e.g., the JDK, is pre-compiled into a native executable.This will tremendously speed up the startup of any JavaScript application, as GraalVM can immediately start to compile JavaScript code, without itself requiring to be compiled first.This mode, however, will only give GraalVM access to Java classes known at the time of image creation.Most significantly, this means that the JavaScript-to-Java interoperability features are not available in this mode, as they would require dynamic class loading and execution of arbitrary Java code at runtime.Can npm packages be installed globally?Node packages can be installed globally using npm and the -g option, both with the original Node.js implementation and GraalVM.While the original Node.js implementation has one main folder (NODE/bin) to put binaries and globally installed packages and their commandline tools, GraalVM has several: the main GRAALVM/bin folder, and separate folders for each language, e.g. GRAALVM/jre/languages/js/bin.When installing npm packages globally in GraalVM, links to the executables e.g. for command line interface tools are put to the JavaScript-specific folder.In order for globally installed packages to function properly, you might need to add GRAALVM/jre/languages/js/bin to your $PATH.Another option is to specify the global installation folder of npm by setting the $PREFIX environment variable, or by specifying the --prefix option when running npm install.For more details, see Installing npm Packages Globally.ErrorsTypeError: Access to host class com.myexample.MyClass is not allowed or does not existReason:  You are trying to access a Java class that is not known to the js or node process, or is not among the allowed classes your code can access.Solution:  Ensure there is no typo in the class name.  Ensure the class is on the classpath. Use the --vm.cp=&amp;lt;classpath&amp;gt; option of the launchers.  Ensure access to the class is permitted, by having @HostAccess.Export on your class and/or the Context.Builder.allowHostAccess() set to a permissive setting. See JavaDoc of org.graalvm.polyglot.Context.TypeError: UnsupportedTypeExceptionTypeError: execute on JavaObject[Main$$Lambda$63/1898325501@1be2019a (Main$$Lambda$63/1898325501)] failed due to: UnsupportedTypeExceptionReason:  GraalVM JavaScript in some cases does not allow concrete callback types when calling from JavaScript to Java. A Java function expecting, e.g., a Value object, might fail with the quoted error message due to that.Solution:  Change the signature in the Java callback method.Status:  This is a known limitation and should be resolved in future versions.Example:import java.util.function.Function;import org.graalvm.polyglot.Context;import org.graalvm.polyglot.Value;import org.graalvm.polyglot.HostAccess;public class Minified {  public static void main(String ... args) {    //change signature to Function&amp;lt;Object, String&amp;gt; to make it work    Function&amp;lt;Value, String&amp;gt; javaCallback = (test) -&amp;gt; {      return &quot;passed&quot;;    };    try(Context ctx = Context.newBuilder()    .allowHostAccess(HostAccess.ALL)    .build()) {      Value jsFn = ctx.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;f =&amp;gt; function() { return f(arguments); }&quot;);      Value javaFn = jsFn.execute(javaCallback);      System.out.println(&quot;finished: &quot;+javaFn.execute());    }  }}TypeError: Message not supportedTypeError: execute on JavaObject[Main$$Lambda$62/953082513@4c60d6e9 (Main$$Lambda$62/953082513)] failed due to: Message not supported.Reason:  You are trying to execute an operation (a message) on a polyglot object that this object does not handle. E.g., you are calling Value.execute() on a non-executable object.  A security setting (e.g., org.graalvm.polyglot.HostAccess) might prevent the operation.Solution:  Ensure the object (type) in question does handle the respective message.  Specifically, ensure the JavaScript operation you try to execute on a Java type is possible semantically in Java. For instance, while you can push a value to an array in JavaScript and thus automatically grow the array, arrays in Java are of fixed length and trying to push to them will result in a Message not supported failure. You might want to wrap Java objects for such cases, e.g., as a ProxyArray.  Ensure access to the class is permitted, by having @HostAccess.Export on your class and/or the Context.Builder.allowHostAccess() set to a permissive setting. See JavaDoc of org.graalvm.polyglot.Context.  Are you trying to call a Java Lambda expression or Functional Interface? Annotating the proper method with @HostAccess.Export can be a pitfall. While you can annotate the method the functional interface refers to, the interface itself (or the Lambda class created in the background) fails to be properly annotated and recognized as exported. See below for examples highlighting the problem and a working solution.An example that triggers a Message not supported error with certain HostAccess settings, e.g., HostAccess.EXPLICIT:{  ...  //a JS function expecting a function as argument  Value jsFn = ...;  //called with a functional interface as argument  jsFn.execute((Function&amp;lt;Integer, Integer&amp;gt;)this::javaFn);  ...}@Exportpublic Object javaFn(Object x) { ... }@Exportpublic Callable&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; lambda42 = () -&amp;gt; 42;In the example above, the method javaFn is seemingly annotated with @Export, but the functional interface passed to jsFn is not, as the functional interface behaves like a wrapper around javaFn, thus hiding the annotation.Neither is lambda42 properly annotated - that pattern annotates the field lambda42, not its executable function in the generated lambda class.In order to add the @Export annotation to a functional interface, use this pattern instead:import java.util.function.Function;import org.graalvm.polyglot.Context;import org.graalvm.polyglot.Value;import org.graalvm.polyglot.HostAccess;public class FAQ {  public static void main(String[] args) {    try(Context ctx = Context.newBuilder()    .allowHostAccess(HostAccess.EXPLICIT)    .build()) {      Value jsFn = ctx.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;f =&amp;gt; function() { return f(arguments); }&quot;);      Value javaFn = jsFn.execute(new MyExportedFunction());      System.out.println(&quot;finished: &quot; + javaFn.execute());    }  }  @FunctionalInterface  public static class MyExportedFunction implements Function&amp;lt;Object, String&amp;gt; {    @Override    @HostAccess.Export    public String apply(Object s) {      return &quot;passed&quot;;    }  };}Another option is to allow access to java.function.Function’s apply method.However, note that this allows access to ALL instances of this interface - in most production setups, this will be too permissive and open potential security holes.HostAccess ha = HostAccess.newBuilder(HostAccess.EXPLICIT)  //warning: too permissive for use in production  .allowAccess(Function.class.getMethod(&quot;apply&quot;, Object.class))  .build();Warning: Implementation does not support runtime compilation.If you get the following warning, you are not running on GraalVM JDK, or a compatible Oracle JDK or OpenJDK using the Graal Compiler:[engine] WARNING: The polyglot context is using an implementation that does not support runtime compilation.The guest application code will therefore be executed in interpreted mode only.Execution only in interpreted mode will strongly impact the guest application performance.To disable this warning the &#39;--engine.WarnInterpreterOnly=false&#39; option or use the &#39;-Dpolyglot.engine.WarnInterpreterOnly=false&#39; system property.To resolve this, use GraalVM or see the Run GraalVM JavaScript on a Stock JDK guide for instructions how to set up the Graal compiler on a compatible Graal-enabled stock JDK.Nevertheless, if this is intentional, you can disable the warning and continue to run with degraded performance by setting the above mentioned option, either via the command line or using the Context.Builder, e.g.:try (Context ctx = Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;)    .option(&quot;engine.WarnInterpreterOnly&quot;, &quot;false&quot;)    .build()) {  ctx.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;console.log(&#39;Greetings!&#39;);&quot;);}Note that when using an explicit polyglot engine, the option has to be set on the Engine, e.g.:try (Engine engine = Engine.newBuilder()    .option(&quot;engine.WarnInterpreterOnly&quot;, &quot;false&quot;)    .build()) {  try (Context ctx = Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;).engine(engine).build()) {    ctx.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;console.log(&#39;Greetings!&#39;);&quot;);  }}",

          "content": "Foreign Function and Memory API in Native ImageThe Foreign Function and Memory (FFM) API is an interface that enables Java code to interact with native code and vice versa.It is finalized in JDK 22 with JEP 454.Support in Native Image is currently experimental and must be explicitly enabled with -H:+ForeignAPISupport (in addition to -H:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions).Modules that are permitted to perform “restricted” native operations (including creating handles for calls to or from native code) must be specified using the --enable-native-access= option.This page gives an overview of the FFM API support in Native Image.Foreign MemoryForeign memory functionality is generally supported. Shared arenas are currently not supported.Foreign FunctionsThe FFM API enables Java code to call down to native functions, and conversely allows native code to call up to invoke Java code via method handles.These two kinds of calls are referred to as “downcalls” and “upcalls” respectively, and are collectively referred to as “foreign calls”.  Note: Currently, only downcalls are supported, and only on the x64 architecture.Looking Up Native FunctionsThe FFM API provides the SymbolLookup interface to find functions in native libraries by name.SymbolLookup.loaderLookup() is currently the only supported kind of SymbolLookup.Registering Foreign CallsIn order to perform calls to native code at run time, supporting code must be generated at image build time.Therefore, the native-image tool must be provided with descriptors that characterize the functions to which downcalls may be performed at run time.These descriptors can be registered using a custom Feature, for example:import static java.lang.foreign.ValueLayout.*;class ForeignRegistrationFeature implements Feature {   public void duringSetup(DuringSetupAccess access) {    RuntimeForeignAccess.registerForDowncall(FunctionDescriptor.ofVoid());    RuntimeForeignAccess.registerForDowncall(FunctionDescriptor.ofVoid(), Linker.Option.isTrivial());    RuntimeForeignAccess.registerForDowncall(FunctionDescriptor.of(JAVA_INT, JAVA_INT, JAVA_INT));    RuntimeForeignAccess.registerForDowncall(FunctionDescriptor.of(ADDRESS, JAVA_INT, JAVA_INT), Linker.Option.firstVariadicArg(1));    RuntimeForeignAccess.registerForDowncall(FunctionDescriptor.ofVoid(JAVA_INT), Linker.Option.captureCallState(&quot;errno&quot;));  }}To activate the custom feature, pass the --features=com.example.ForeignRegistrationFeature option (the fully-qualified name of the feature class) to native-image.It is recommended to do so with a native-image.properties file.UpcallsUpcalls are not yet supported.Related Documentation  Interoperability with Native Code",

          "title": "Host Compilation for Interpreter Java code",
          "content": "Host Compilation for Interpreter Java codeFor the following document, we disambiguate between host and guest compilation.  Host compilation is applied to the Java implementation of the interpreter. If the interpreter runs on HotSpot, this kind of compilation is applied when Truffle interpreters are JIT compiled (or dynamically compiled) as Java applications. This compilation is applied ahead of time during native image generation.  Guest compilation is applied to guest language code. This kind of compilation uses Partial Evaluation and Futamura projections to derive optimized code from Truffle ASTs and bytecodes.This section discusses domain-specific host compilations applied to Truffle AST and bytecode interpreters.Host InliningTruffle interpreters are written to support runtime compilation by applying the first Futamura projection.Runtime compilable code, also often referred to as partial evaluatable code, has the following characteristics:  It is naturally designed for high-performance, as it also defines the performance after runtime compilation of a language.  It is written to avoid recursion, as recursive code cannot quickly be partially evaluated.  It avoids complex abstractions and third-party code as they are typically not designed for PE.  The boundaries of partially evaluatable code are reliably defined by methods annotated with @TruffleBoundary, blocks dominated by a call to CompilerDirectives.transferToInterpreter() or a  block protected by a call to CompilerDirectives.inInterpreter().Truffle host inlining leverages these properties and forces inlining during host compilation for runtime compilable code paths as much as possible.The general assumption is that code important for runtime compilation is also important for interpreter execution.Whenever a PE boundary is detected, the host inlining phase no longer makes any inlining decisions and defers them to later inlining phases better suited for regular Java code.The source code for this phase can be found in HostInliningPhase.Truffle host inlining is applied when compiling a method annotated with @HostCompilerDirectives.BytecodeInterpreterSwitch.The maximum node cost for such methods can be configured using -H:TruffleHostInliningByteCodeInterpreterBudget=100000 for native images and -Djdk.graal.TruffleHostInliningByteCodeInterpreterBudget=100000 on HotSpot. If a method that is annotated with  @BytecodeInterpreterSwitch calls a method with the same annotation then the method is directly inlined as long as the cost of both methods do not exceed the budget.In other words, any such method will be treated by the inlining phase just as if they would be part of the root bytecode switch method.This allows bytecode interpreter switches to be composed of multiple methods if needed.Native image, during closed world analysis, computes all methods that are reachable for runtime compilation.Any potentially reachable method from RootNode.execute(...) is determined as runtime compilable.For native images, in addition to bytecode interpreter switches, all runtime compilable methods are optimized using Truffle host inlining.The maximum node cost of such an inlining pass can be configured with -H:TruffleHostInliningBaseBudget=5000. On HotSpot the set of runtime compilable methods is unknown.Therefore, we can only rely on regular Java method inlining for methods not annotated as bytecode interpreter switch on HotSpot.Whenever the maximum budget for a compilation unit is reached, inlining will be stopped. The same budget will be used for the exploration of subtrees during inlining.If a call cannot be fully explored and inlined within the budget, then no decision is taken on the individual subtree.For the vast majority of runtime compilable methods, this limit will not be reached, as it is prevented by natural PE boundaries as well as polymorphic calls to execute methods of @Child nodes.If there are methods that exceed the budget limit, then the recommendation is to optimize such nodes by adding more PE boundaries.If a method exceeds the limit, it is likely that the same code also has a high cost for runtime compilation.Debugging Host InliningThe inlining decisions performed by this phase is best debugged with -H:Log=HostInliningPhase,~CanonicalizerPhase,~GraphBuilderPhase for native images or  -Djdk.graal.Log=HostInliningPhase,~CanonicalizerPhase,~GraphBuilderPhase on HotSpot.You can redirect the output to a file with -Djdk.graal.LogFile=FILE (works for both).Consider the following example, which shows previously described common patterns of partial evaluatable code in Truffle interpreters:class BytecodeNode extends Node {    @CompilationFinal(dimensions = 1) final byte[] ops;    @Children final BaseNode[] polymorphic = new BaseNode[]{new SubNode1(), new SubNode2()};    @Child SubNode1 monomorphic = new SubNode1();    BytecodeNode(byte[] ops) {        this.ops = ops;    }    @BytecodeInterpreterSwitch    @ExplodeLoop(kind = LoopExplosionKind.MERGE_EXPLODE)    public void execute() {        int bci = 0;        while (bci &amp;lt; ops.length) {            switch (ops[bci++]) {                case 0:                    // regular operation                    add(21, 21);                    break;                case 1:                    // complex operation in @TruffleBoundary annotated method                    truffleBoundary();                    break;                case 2:                    // complex operation protected behind inIntepreter                    if (CompilerDirectives.inInterpreter()) {                        protectedByInIntepreter();                    }                    break;                case 3:                    // complex operation dominated by transferToInterpreter                    CompilerDirectives.transferToInterpreterAndInvalidate();                    dominatedByTransferToInterpreter();                    break;                case 4:                    // first level of recursion is inlined                    recursive(5);                    break;                case 5:                    // can be inlined is still monomorphic (with profile)                    monomorphic.execute();                    break;                case 6:                    for (int y = 0; y &amp;lt; polymorphic.length; y++) {                        // can no longer be inlined (no longer monomorphic)                        polymorphic[y].execute();                    }                    break;                default:                    // propagates transferToInterpeter from within the call                    throw CompilerDirectives.shouldNotReachHere();            }        }    }    private static int add(int a, int b) {        return a + b;    }    private void protectedByInIntepreter() {    }    private void dominatedByTransferToInterpreter() {    }    private void recursive(int i) {        if (i == 0) {            return;        }        recursive(i - 1);    }    @TruffleBoundary    private void truffleBoundary() {    }    abstract static class BaseNode extends Node {        abstract int execute();    }    static class SubNode1 extends BaseNode {        @Override        int execute() {            return 42;        }    }    static class SubNode2 extends BaseNode {        @Override        int execute() {            return 42;        }    }}We can run this as a unittest in the Graal repository (see class HostInliningBytecodeInterpreterExampleTest) by running the following command line in graal/compiler:mx unittest  -Djdk.graal.Log=HostInliningPhase,~CanonicalizerPhase,~GraphBuilderPhase -Djdk.graal.Dump=:3  HostInliningBytecodeInterpreterExampleTestThis prints:[thread:1] scope: main  [thread:1] scope: main.Testing  Context: HotSpotMethod&amp;lt;HostInliningBytecodeInterpreterExampleTest$BytecodeNode.execute()&amp;gt;  Context: StructuredGraph:1{HotSpotMethod&amp;lt;HostInliningBytecodeInterpreterExampleTest$BytecodeNode.execute()&amp;gt;}      [thread:1] scope: main.Testing.EnterpriseHighTier.HostInliningPhase      Truffle host inlining completed after 2 rounds.

After that, a Java profiler may be used to identify hot spots in the execution.For further details on profiling, see Profiling.mdIf you are looking for advice on how and when to optimize Truffle interpreters, see Optimizing.mdAfter identifying a hot method, for example, the bytecode dispatch loop in a Truffle bytecode interpreter, we can further investigate using host inlining logging as described in the previous section.Interesting entries are prefixed with CUTOFF and have a reason that explains the reason for the individual cutoff.Common reasons for CUTOFF entries are:  dominated by transferToInterpreter() or protected by inInterpreter(): This means that the is call performed in a slow-path. Host inlining will not decide on such calls and just mark them as CUTOFF.  target method not inlinable this happens for host VM methods that cannot be inlined. There is typically not much we can do about that.  Out of budget we ran out of budget for inlining this method. This happens if the cost of the method becomes too high.Additionally, to avoid the explosion of code size, host inlining has a built-in heuristic to detect call subtrees that are considered too complex to inline. For example, the tracing may print the following:CUTOFF com.oracle.truffle.espresso.nodes.BytecodeNode.putPoolConstant(VirtualFrame, int, char, int)   [inlined   -1, explored    0, monomorphic false, deopt false, inInterpreter false, propDeopt false, graphSize 1132, subTreeCost 5136, invokes    1, subTreeInvokes   12, forced false, incomplete false,  reason call has too many fast-path invokes - too complex, please optimize, see truffle/docs/HostOptimization.mdThis indicates that there are too many fast-path invokes (by default 10) in the subtree, it also stops exploring after that number.The -Djdk.graal.TruffleHostInliningPrintExplored=true flag may be provided to see the entire subtree for the decision.The following calls are considered fast-path invokes:  Invokes where the target method is annotated by @TruffleBoundary.  Invokes that are polymorphic or where no monomorphic profiling feedback is available. For example, a call to a subexpression’s execute method.  Invokes that are recursive.  Invokes that are too complex themselves. For example, invokes that have too many fast-path invokes.The following calls are not considered fast-path invokes:  Invokes that can be inlined using the host inlining heuristic.  Invokes in a slow-path, like any invoke that is dominated by transferToInterpreter() or protected by isInterpreter().  Invokes that cannot be inlined due to limitations of the host VM, like calls to Throwable.fillInStackTrace().  Invokes that are no longer reachable.It is impossible to avoid fast-path invokes entirely, as, for example, child nodes need to be executed in an AST.It is theoretically possible to avoid all fast-path invokes in a bytecode interpreter. In practice, languages will rely on @TruffleBoundary to the runtime to implement more complex bytecodes.In the following sections, we discuss techniques on how to improve host interpreter code:Optimization: Manually cut code paths with @HostCompilerDirectives.InliningCutoffAs mentioned in the previous section, a heuristic automatically cuts inlining subtrees with too many calls in them.One way to optimize this is by using the @InliningCutoff annotation.Consider the following example:abstract class AddNode extends Node {   abstract Object execute(Object a, Object b);   @Specialization int doInt(int a, int b) { return a + b; }      @Specialization double doDouble(double a, double b) { return a + b; }      @Specialization double doGeneric(Object a, Object b, @Cached LookupAndCallNode callNode) {        return callNode.execute(&quot;__add&quot;, a, b);    }}In this example, the specializations doInt and doDouble are very simple, but there is also the doGeneric specialization, which calls into a complex lookup chain.Assuming that the LookupAndCallNode.execute is a very complex method with more than ten fast-path subtree calls, we could not expect the execute method to get inlined.Host inlining currently does not support automatic component analysis; though it can be specified manually using the @InliningCutoff annotation:abstract class AddNode extends Node {   abstract Object execute(Object a, Object b);   @Specialization int doInt(int a, int b) { return a + b; }      @Specialization double doDouble(double a, double b) { return a + b; }      @HostCompilerDirectives.InliningCutoff   @Specialization double doGeneric(Object a, Object b, @Cached LookupAndCallNode callNode) {        return callNode.execute(&quot;__add__&quot;, a, b);    }}After changing the code, host inlining may now decide to inline the execute method of the AddNode if it fits into the host inlining budget, but force a CUTOFF at the doGeneric(...) method call.Please see the javadoc on other use-cases for using this annotation.Optimization: Deduplicating calls from branches that fold during partial evaluationThe following is an example where the code is efficient for compilation using partial evaluation but is not ideal for host compilation.@Child HelperNode helperNode;final boolean negate;// ....int execute(int argument) {if (negate) {return helperNode.execute(-argument);} else {         return helperNode.execute(argument);}}When this code is compiled using partial evaluation, this code is efficient as the condition is guaranteed to fold to a single case, as the negate field is compilation final. During host optimization, the negate field is not compilation final, and the compiler would either inline the code twice or decide not to inline the execute method.In order to avoid this the code can be rewritten as follows:@Child HelperNode helperNode;final boolean negate;// ....int execute(int argument) {    int negatedArgument;    if (negate) {        negatedArgument = -argument;    } else {        negatedArgument = argument;    }    return helperNode.execute(negatedArgument);}Similar code patterns can arise indirectly through code generation if many specializations with the same method body are used.Host compilers typically have a hard time optimizing such patterns automatically.Optimization: Extract complex slow-path code in separate methodsConsider the following example:int execute(int argument) {if (argument == 0) {   CompilerDirectives.transferToInterpeterAndInvalidate();   throw new RuntimeException(&quot;Invalid zero argument &quot; + argument);}return argument;}The Java compiler generates bytecode equivalent to the following code:int execute(int argument) {if (argument == 0) {   CompilerDirectives.transferToInterpeterAndInvalidate();   throw new RuntimeException(new StringBuilder(&quot;Invalid zero argument &quot;).append(argument).build());}return argument;}While this code is efficient for partial evaluation, this code takes up unnecessary space during host inlining.It is therefore recommended to extract a single method for the slow-path part of the code:int execute(int argument) {if (argument == 0) {   CompilerDirectives.transferToInterpeterAndInvalidate();   throw invalidZeroArgument(argument);}return argument;}RuntimeException invalidZeroArgument(int argument) {   throw new RuntimeException(&quot;Invalid zero argument &quot; + argument);}",

It is necessary to specify -XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions because Intellij automatically adds a -javaagent argument which is not supported yet.Press Debug.This will run the application and start a debugger session in the background.Using HotSwap during a Debugging SessionOnce you have your debugger session running, you will be able to apply extensive code changes (HotSwap) without needing to restart the session.Feel free to try this out on your own applications or by following these instructions:  Create a new Java application.      Use the following main method as a starting point:           public class HotSwapDemo {           private static final int ITERATIONS = 100;           public static void main(String[] args) {               HotSwapDemo demo = new HotSwapDemo();               System.out.println(&quot;Starting HotSwap demo with Java on Truffle: &#39;java.vm.name&#39; = &quot; + System.getProperty(&quot;java.vm.name&quot;));               // run something in a loop               for (int i = 1; i &amp;lt;= ITERATIONS; i++) {                   demo.runDemo(i);               }               System.out.println(&quot;Completed HotSwap demo with Java on Truffle&quot;);           }           public void runDemo(int iteration) {               int random = new Random().nextInt(iteration);               System.out.printf(&quot;titeration %d ran with result: %dn&quot;, iteration, random);           }       }    Check that the java.vm.name property says you’re running on Espresso.  Place a line breakpoint on the first line in runDemo().      Setup the Run configurations to run with Java on Truffle and press Debug. You will see:            While paused at the breakpoint, extract a method from the body of runDemo():            Reload the changes by navigating to Run -&amp;gt; Debugging Actions -&amp;gt; Reload Changed Classes:            Verify that the change was applied by noticing the &amp;lt;obsolete&amp;gt;:-1 current frame in the Debug -&amp;gt; Frames view:            Place a breakpoint on the first line of the new extracted method and press Resume Program. The breakpoint will hit:            Try to change the access modifiers of printRandom() from private to public static. Reload the changes. Press Resume Program to verify the change was applied:      Watch the video version of the enhanced HotSwap capabilities with Java on Truffle demo.Supported ChangesThe enhanced HotSwap of Java on Truffle is almost feature complete.The following changes are supported:  Add and remove methods  Add and remove constructors  Add and remove methods from interfaces  Change access modifiers of methods  Change access modifiers of constructors  Add and remove fields  Change field type  Move field in hierarchy and preserve state (see note below)  Changes to class access modifiers, e.g. abstract and final modifiers  Changes to Lambdas  Add new anonymous inner classes  Remove anonymous inner classes  Changing the superclass  Changing implemented interfacesNote: When instance fields are moved in the class hierarchy the state is preserved whenever possible.Examples include the Pull Up Field refactoring where all existing instances of the origin subclass will be able to read the previously stored value from the super class field.On the other hand, for unrelated subclass instances where the field was not present prior to the change, the new field value will be the language default (i.e. null for object-type fields, 0 for int etc.).As of GraalVM 22.1.0, the following limitations remain:  Changes to EnumsHotSwap Plugin APIWith Java on Truffle you can benefit from enhanced HotSwap capabilities that allow the code to evolve naturally during development without the need for restarting a running application.While code reloading (HotSwap) is a powerful tool, it is not sufficient to reflect all kinds of changes, e.g., changes to annotations, framework-specific changes such as implemented services or beans.For these things the code often needs to be executed to reload configurations or contexts before the changes are fully reflected in the running instance.This is where the Truffle on Java HotSwap Plugin API comes in handy.The Truffle on Java HotSwap Plugin API is meant for framework developers by setting up appropriate hooks to reflect changes in response to source code edits in your IDE.The main design principle is that you can register various HotSwap listeners that will be fired on specified HotSwap events.Examples include the ability to re-run a static initializer, a generic post HotSwap callback and hooks when implementations for a certain service provider changes.Note: The HotSwap Plugin API is under development and more fine-grained registration of HotSwap listeners are likely to be added upon requests from the community.You are welcomed to send enhancement requests to help shape the API through our community support channels.Review the HotSwap Plugin API by going through a running example that will enable more powerful reloading support on Micronaut.Micronaut HotSwap PluginThe Micronaut HotSwap plugin example implementation is hosted as a fork of Micronaut-core.The following instructions are based on a macOS X setup and only minor variations are needed for Windows.To get started:  Clone the repository:      git clone git@github.com:javeleon/micronaut-core.git    Build and publish to local Maven repository:      cd micronaut-core  ./gradlew publishMavenPublicationToMavenLocal  Now you will have a HotSwap-ready version of Micronaut.Before setting up a sample application that uses the enhanced version of Micronaut, look at what the plugin does under the hood.The interesting class is MicronautHotSwapPlugin which holds on to an application context that can be reloaded when certain changes are made to the application source code.The class looks like this:final class MicronautHotSwapPlugin implements HotSwapPlugin {    private final ApplicationContext context;    private boolean needsBeenRefresh = false;    MicronautHotSwapPlugin(ApplicationContext context) {        this.context = context;        // register class re-init for classes that provide annotation metadata        EspressoHotSwap.registerClassInitHotSwap(                AnnotationMetadataProvider.class,                true,                () -&amp;gt; needsBeenRefresh = true);        // register ServiceLoader listener for declared bean definitions        EspressoHotSwap.registerMetaInfServicesListener(                BeanDefinitionReference.class,                context.getClassLoader(),                () -&amp;gt; reloadContext());        EspressoHotSwap.registerMetaInfServicesListener(                BeanIntrospectionReference.class,                context.getClassLoader(),                () -&amp;gt; reloadContext());    }    @Override    public String getName() {        return &quot;Micronaut HotSwap Plugin&quot;;    }    @Override    public void postHotSwap(Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] changedClasses) {        if (needsBeenRefresh) {            reloadContext();

       // now restart the embedded app/server        bean.ifPresent(ApplicationContextLifeCycle::start);    }}The logic regarding the HotSwap API sits in the constructor of this class.Micronaut is architected around compile-time annotation processing where annotation metadata is gathered and stored into static fields in generated classes.Whenever a developer makes a change to a Micronaut-annotated class, the corresponding metadata classes are re-generated.Since standard HotSwap does not (and it should not) re-run static initializers, with HotSwap Plugin static initializer are re-run for all classes that provide metadata (the Micronaut-generated classes). Thus, this API method EspressoHotSwap.registerClassInitHotSwap is used:public static boolean registerClassInitHotSwap(Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; klass, boolean onChange, HotSwapAction action)This will register a listener on Class changes for the specific class and importantly any subclass thereof.The onChange variable instructs if static initializers should only be re-run if the code within changed.The action parameter is a hook for firing a specific action whenever a static initializer has been re-run.Here we pass a function for setting the needsBeenRefresh field to true whenever an static initializer is re-run.Upon completion of a HotSwap action the plugin receives a postHotSwap call that, in response to a true needsBeenRefresh, executes the Micronaut-specific code to reload the application context in the reloadContext method.Detecting and Injecting New ClassesHotSwap is designed to enable classes to be HotSwap’ed in a running application.However, if a developer introduces an entirely new class, e.g., a new @Controller class in Micronaut, HotSwap does not magically inject a new class, as doing so would require knowledge about internal classloading logic at the very least.A standard way in which classes are discovered by a framework is through the ServiceLoader mechanism.The Truffle on Java HotSwap API has built-in support for registering service implementation change listeners by means of the method EspressoHotSwap.registerMetaInfServicesListener:public static boolean registerMetaInfServicesListener(Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; serviceType, ClassLoader loader, HotSwapAction action)The current support is limited to listening for implementation changes for class path based service deployment in META-INF/services.Whenever there is a change to the set of service implementations for the registered class type, the action is fired.In the Micronaut HotSwap plugin, reloadContext is executed which will then pickup the changes automatically.Note: HotSwap actions caused by changes to service implementation changes are fired indepent of HotSwap. As a developer, you do not need to perform a HotSwap from your IDE to see the new functionality in the running application.Next-Level HotSwap for MicronautNow that you know how the Micronaut HotSwap plugin works, use this feature in a real application.Here is a sample application created from the tutorial “Creating your first Micronaut Graal Application”.Example’s sources can be downloaded as a ready-made Gradle project from here.Download, unzip and open the project in your IDE.Before you proceed, make sure that you have Java on Truffle installed and set the GraalVM as the project SDK.  In your IDE navigate to the root build.gradle within the sample project. Add:    run.jvmArgs+=&quot;-truffle&quot;    Also add maven local repository where we previously published the enhanced Micronaut framework. For example:    repositories {  mavenLocal()  ...}    In gradle.properties update the Micronaut version that you published. For example:    micronautVersion=2.5.8-SNAPSHOT    Now you are all setup.        Executeassemble task and create a run configuration using the defined run gradle task.        Press the Debug button to start the application in debugging mode, which enables enhanced HotSwap support.        Once the application is started, verify that you get a response from the ConferenceController by going to http://localhost:8080/conferences/random.    Try to make various changes to the classes within the sample app, e.g., change the @Controller mapping to a different value, or add a new @Getannotated method and apply HotSwap to see the magic. In case you define a new @Controller class, all you need is compiling the class and once the change is picked up by the file system watch, you will see the reload without the need for explicitly HotSwap.",

          "content": "Implementation DetailsJava on Truffle operates, like other languages implemented with Truffle, both as a native executable or on top of HotSpot (currently possible on Linux only).In the first case, when the Java on Truffle runtime is compiled to a native executable, it does not require HotSpot to run Java.However it requires a standard core Java library (the rt.jar library for Java 8 or the lib/modules file for Java 11 as well as the associated native libraries: libjava, libnio, etc.).Java on Truffle is a minified Java VM that implements all core components of a VM including:  Bytecode interpreter  Bytecode verifier  Single Java Class File parser  Simple object model  Java Native Interface (JNI) implementation in Java  Virtual Machine Implementation in Java  Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP)Java on Truffle reuses all JARs and native libraries from GraalVM.All native libraries and methods are loaded/accessed/called via Truffle Native Function Interface (JNI).JNI handles are implemented in Java on Truffle, e.g., all Truffle NFI methods only receive and return primitives.Some methods are substituted for performance, e.g., Math.sqrt, System.arraycopy, avoiding the expensive transition to native.Some native libraries might contain static data that would conflict if were used from multiple Java on Truffle contexts or even from both Java on Truffle and Java running on HotSpot.On Linux, Java on Truffle uses the capability of Truffle NFI to try to load libraries in isolated namespaces (dlmopen). This is only available on Linux with glibc and has many limitations.This mode is not used when running in a native executable since there will be no conflict with HotSpot.Current Limitations  Java on Truffle does not implement the JVM Tool Interface (JVMTI). As a result, it does not support the -agentlib, or -agentpath VM options.  Java on Truffle does not implement the java.lang.instrument interface. As a result it does not support the -javaagent VM option.  Java on Truffle currently uses the standard native libraries from the Java core library. This requires allowing a polyglot Context native access. Because of the way these libraries are loaded (via Truffle NFI), running on top of HotSpot only works on Linux (with glibc). Running as part of a native executable works on Linux, Windows, and macOS but it currently limited to one context.  Support for Java Management Extensions (JMX) is partial and some methods might return partial data.  The Debugger Protocol Implementation (JDWP) lacks some capabilities compared to HotSpot. It will correctly report the supported capabilities. In particular actions that require to enumerate all Java objects are not supported. However it does support a few hot reloading cases that HotSpot does not.  When the java.MultiThreaded option is set to “false”, reference processing will not happen. Depending on the application, this could create resource leaks. Note that this option is set to “false” automatically if Java on Truffle runs in a context where a single-threaded language is enabled (e.g., JavaScript).  Java on Truffle does not support the Polyglot API yet. However, it provides a guest Java Polyglot API, described in polyglot.jar. For more information, see Interoperability with Truffle Languages.",

          "title": "Truffle Approach to Function Inlining",
          "content": "Truffle Approach to Function InliningTruffle provides automated inlining for all languages built with the framework.Since the 20.2.0 release a new approach to inlining was introduced.This document describes how the new approach works, compares it to the legacyinlining approach, and motivates the design choices made for the new approach.InliningInlining is the process of replacing a call to a function with the body of that function.This removes the overhead of the call but more importantly it opens up more optimization opportunities for later phases of the compiler.The down side of the process is that the size of the compilation grows with each inlined function.Overly large compilation units are hard to optimize and there is finite memory for installing code.Because of all this, choosing which functions to inline is a delicate trade-offbetween the expected gains of inlining a function versus the cost of theincrease of the size of the compilation unit.Truffle Legacy InliningTruffle has had an approach to inlining for quite a while.Unfortunately, this early approach suffered from multiple issues, the main one being that it relied on the number of Truffle AST nodes in a call target to approximate the size of the call target.AST nodes are a very poor proxy for actual code size of the call target since there is no guarantee how much code a single AST node will produce.For example, an addition node specialized for adding two integers will produce significantly less code than that same node if specialized for adding integers, doubles, and strings (not to mention a different node and nodes from different languages).This made it impossible to have a single inlining approach that would work reliably across all the Truffle languages.One notable thing about the legacy inlining is that, since it only uses information from the AST, inlining decisions are made before partial evaluation begins.This means that we only ever partially evaluate call targets that we decide to inline.The advantage of this approach is that no time is spent on the partial evaluation of call targets that do not end up being inlined.On the other hand this results in frequent compilation problems stemming from the poor decisions made by the inliner.For example, the resulting compilation unit would be too big to compile.Language-agnostic InliningThe main design goal of the new inlining approach is to use the number of Graal nodes (compiler nodes) after partial evaluation as a proxy for call target size.This is a much better size proxy since partial evaluation removes all the abstractions of the AST and results in a graph that is much closer to the low-level instructions that the call target actually performs.This results in a more precise cost model when deciding whether or not to inline a call target, and it removes much ofthe language-specific information that the AST carries (hence the name: Language-agnostic inlining).This is achieved by performing partial evaluation on every candidate call target and then making the inlining decision after that (as opposed to the legacy inlining which made decisions before doing any partial evaluation).Both the amount of partial evaluation that will be done as well as the amount that will be inlined are controlled by the notion of budgets.These are the “exploration budget” and “inlining budget” respectively, both expressed in terms of Graal node counts.The downside of this approach is that we need to do partial evaluation even on call targets which we ultimately decide not to inline.This results in a measurable increase in average compilation time compared to legacy inlining (approximate 10%).Observing and Impacting the InliningThe inliner keeps an internal call tree to keep track of the states of individual calls to targets, as well as the inlining decisions that were made.The following sections explain the states in which calls in the call tree can be, as well as how to find out which decisions were made during compilations.Call Tree StatesNodes in the inline call treerepresent calls to particular targets.This means that if one target calls another twice, we will see this as two nodes despite it being the same call target.Each node can be in one of six states explained here:  Inlined - This state means that the call was inlined. Initially, only theroot of the compilation is in this state since it is implicitly “inlined”(i.e., part of the compilation unit).  Cutoff - This state means that the call target was not partially evaluated,thus was not even considered for inlining. This is normally due to theinliner hitting its exploration budget limitations.  Expanded - This state means that the call target was partially evaluated(thus, considered for inlining) but a decision was made not to inline. Thiscould be due to inlining budget limitations or the target being deemed tooexpensive to inline (e.g., inlining a small target with multiple outgoing“Cutoff” calls would just introduce more calls to the compilation unit).  Removed - This state means that this call is present in the AST but partialevaluation removed the call. This is an advantage over the legacy inliningwhich made the decisions ahead of time and had no way of noticing suchsituations.  Indirect - This state denotes an indirect call. We cannot inline an indirectcall.  BailedOut - This state should be very rare and is considered a performanceproblem. It means that partial evaluation of the target resulted in aBailoutException, i.e., it could not be completed successfully. This means there issome problem with that particular target, but rather than quit the entirecompilation, we treat that call as not possible to inline.Tracing Inlining DecisionsTruffle provides an engine option to trace the final state of the call tree, including a lot of accompanying data, during compilation.This option is TraceInlining and can be set in all the usual ways: by adding --engine.TraceInlining=true to the language launchers, adding -Dpolyglot.engine.TraceInlining=true to the command line ifrunning a regular Java program that executes guest languages (languages implemented with Truffle), or setting the option explicitly for an engine.Here is an example output of TraceInlining for a JavaScript function:[engine] inline start     M.CollidePolygons                                           |call diff        0.00 |Recursion Depth      0 |Explore/inline ratio     1.07 |IR Nodes        27149 |Frequency        1.00 |Truffle Callees     14 |Forced          false |Depth               0[engine] Inlined            M.FindMaxSeparation &amp;lt;opt&amp;gt;

Increasing this budget will likely result in more candidates being inlined, which will result in a larger compilation unit. This, in turn might slow down compilation, notably in the post partial evaluation phases since larger graphs take more time to optimize.It may also improve performance (removed calls, optimization phases have a bigger picture) or hurt performance, e.g., when a graph is too big to optimize correctly or to compile at all.",

          "content": "Embedding Insight into ApplicationsEmbedding Insight into JavaGraalVM languages (languages implemented with the Truffle framework, i.e., JavaScript, Python, Ruby, R) can be embedded into custom Java applications via Polyglot Context API.GraalVM Insight can also be controlled via the same API.For example:final Engine engine = context.getEngine();Instrument instrument = engine.getInstruments().get(&quot;insight&quot;);Function&amp;lt;Source, AutoCloseable&amp;gt; access = instrument.lookup(Function.class);AutoCloseable handle = access.apply(agentSrc);Obtain Engine for Context and ask for the insight instrument.Then create Source with the GraalVM Insight script and apply it while obtaining its instrumentation handle.Use handle.close() to disable all the script’s instrumentations when when no longer needed.Ignoring Internal ScriptsOften one wants to treat certain code written in a dynamic language as a priviledged one.Imagine various bindings to OS concepts or other features of one’s application.Such scripts are better to remain blackboxed and hidden from GraalVM Insight instrumentation capabilities.To hide priviledged scripts from sight, mark them as internal.By default GraalVM Insight ignores and does not process internal scripts.Extending Functionality of Insight ScriptsWhen embedding GraalVM Insight into a Java application, you can make additional objects available to the Insight scripts being evaluated.For example:@TruffleInstrument.Registration(    id = &quot;meaningOfWorld&quot;, name = &quot;Meaning Of World&quot;, version = &quot;demo&quot;,    services = { Insight.SymbolProvider.class })public final class MeaningOfWorldInstrument extends TruffleInstrument {    @Override    protected void onCreate(Env env) {        Map&amp;lt;String, Integer&amp;gt; symbols = Collections.singletonMap(&quot;meaning&quot;, 42);        Insight.SymbolProvider provider = () -&amp;gt; symbols;        env.registerService(provider);    }}The previous Java code creates an instrument which registers a new symbol meaning to every Insight script evaluated.Each script can then reference it and use it, for example, to limit the number of method invocations:insight.on(&#39;enter&#39;, (ctx, frames) =&amp;gt; { if (--meaning &amp;lt;= 0) throw &#39;Stop!&#39; }, { roots : true });It is possible to expose simple values, as well as complex objects.See the javadoc for more detailed information.Note that instrumentation can alter many aspects of program execution and are not subject to any security sandbox.Embedding Insight into Node.jsThe Insight Manual shows many examples of using GraalVM Insight with node.However most of them rely on the command line option --insight and do not benefit from the dynamic nature of the tool.The next example shows how to create an admin server.Save this code to adminserver.js:function initialize(insight, require) {    const http = require(&quot;http&quot;);    const srv = http.createServer((req, res) =&amp;gt; {        let method = req.method;        if (method === &#39;POST&#39;) {            var data = &#39;&#39;;            req.on(&#39;data&#39;, (chunk) =&amp;gt; {                data += chunk.toString();            });            req.on(&#39;end&#39;, () =&amp;gt; {                const fn = new Function(&#39;insight&#39;, data);                try {                    fn(insight);                    res.write(&#39;GraalVM Insight hook activatedn&#39;);                } finally {                    res.end();                }            });        }    });    srv.listen(9999, () =&amp;gt; console.log(&quot;Admin ready at 9999&quot;));}let waitForRequire = function (event) {  if (typeof process === &#39;object&#39; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; process.mainModule &amp;amp;&amp;amp; process.mainModule.require) {    insight.off(&#39;source&#39;, waitForRequire);    initialize(insight, process.mainModule.require.bind(process.mainModule));  }};insight.on(&#39;source&#39;, waitForRequire, { roots: true });The program opens an HTTP server at port 9999 and listens for incoming scripts to be applied any time later.Invoke the application:node --insight=adminserver.js yourapp.jsAdmin ready at 9999While it is running, connect to the admin port.Send in any GraalVM Insight script to it.For example, the following script is going to observe who calls process.exit:curl --data &#39;insight.on(&quot;enter&quot;, (ctx, frame) =&amp;gt; { console.log(new Error(&quot;call to exit&quot;).stack); }, { roots: true, rootNameFilter: &quot;exit&quot; });&#39; -X POST http://localhost:9999/When writing your own adminserver.js, pay attention to security.Only an authorized person should apply arbitrary hooks to your application.Do not open the admin server port to everybody.What to Read RextTo learn more about Insight and find some usecases, go to the Insight Manual.It starts with an obligatory HelloWorld example and then demonstrates more challenging tasks.",

See Polyglot Programming guide.Apply the JavaScript instrument to the Ruby program. Here is what you should see:./bin/ruby --polyglot --insight=source-trace.js helloworld.rbJavaScript instrument observed load of helloworld.rbHello from GraalVM Ruby!It is necessary to start GraalVM’s Ruby launcher with the --polyglot parameter as the source-tracing.js script remains written in JavaScript.Insights with JavaScriptAs stated in the previous section, GraalVM Insight is not limited to Node.js only.It is available in all languages runtimes GraalVM provides.Try the JavaScript implementation that comes with GraalVM.Create the function-tracing.js script:var count = 0;var next = 8;insight.on(&#39;enter&#39;, function(ev) {    if (count++ % next === 0) {        print(`Just called ${ev.name} as ${count} function invocation`);        next *= 2;    }}, {    roots: true});Run it on top of sieve.js.It is a sample script which uses a variant of the Sieve of Erathostenes to compute one hundred thousand of prime numbers:./bin/js --insight=function-tracing.js sieve.js | grep -v ComputedJust called :program as 1 function invocationJust called Natural.next as 17 function invocationJust called Natural.next as 33 function invocationJust called Natural.next as 65 function invocationJust called Natural.next as 129 function invocationJust called Filter as 257 function invocationJust called Natural.next as 513 function invocationJust called Natural.next as 1025 function invocationJust called Natural.next as 2049 function invocationJust called Natural.next as 4097 function invocationInsights with PythonNot only one can instrument any GraalVM language, but also the Insight scripts can be written in that language.In this section, you will find a Python example.It is possible to write GraalVM Insight scripts in Python.Such insights can be applied to programs written in Python or any other language.Here is an example of a script that prints out value of variable n when a function minusOne is called.Save this code to the agent.py file:def onEnter(ctx, frame):    print(f&quot;minusOne {frame.n}&quot;)class At:    sourcePath = &quot;.*agent-fib.js&quot;class Roots:    roots = True    at = At()    rootNameFilter = &quot;minusOne&quot;insight.on(&quot;enter&quot;, onEnter, Roots())This code uses a declarative specification of source location introduced in GraalVM 22.2. Use a dynamic sourceFilter with older GraalVM versions:def onEnter(ctx, frame):    print(f&quot;minusOne {frame.n}&quot;)class Roots:    roots = True    rootNameFilter = &quot;minusOne&quot;    def sourceFilter(self, src):        return src.name == &quot;agent-fib.js&quot;insight.on(&quot;enter&quot;, onEnter, Roots())Apply this script to agent-fib.js using the following command:`./bin/js --polyglot --insight=agent.py agent-fib.js`Note: Make sure the Python support is enabled. See Polyglot Programming guide.Insights with RubyIt is possible to write GraalVM Insight scripts in Ruby.Such insights can be applied to programs written in Ruby or any other language.Note: Make sure the Ruby support is enabled. See Polyglot Programming guide.Create the source-tracing.rb script:puts(&quot;Ruby: Insight version #{insight.version} is launching&quot;)insight.on(&quot;source&quot;, -&amp;gt; (env) {  puts &quot;Ruby: observed loading of #{env.name}&quot;})puts(&quot;Ruby: Hooks are ready!&quot;)Launch a Node.js application and instrument it with the Ruby script:./bin/node --js.print --experimental-options --polyglot --insight=source-tracing.rb agent-fib.jsRuby: Initializing GraalVM Insight scriptRuby: Hooks are ready!Ruby: observed loading of node:internal/errorsRuby: observed loading of node:internal/utilRuby: observed loading of node:events....Ruby: observed loading of node:internal/modules/run_mainRuby: observed loading of &amp;lt;...&amp;gt;/agent-fib.jsThree is the result 3To track variable values, create agent.rb script:insight.on(&quot;enter&quot;, -&amp;gt; (ctx, frame) {    puts(&quot;minusOne #{frame.n}&quot;)}, {  roots: true,  rootNameFilter: &quot;minusOne&quot;,  at: {    sourcePath: &quot;.*agent-fib.js&quot;  }})This code uses a declarative specification of source location introduced in GraalVM 22.2. Use a dynamic sourceFilter with older GraalVM versions:insight.on(&quot;enter&quot;, -&amp;gt; (ctx, frame) {    puts(&quot;minusOne #{frame.n}&quot;)}, {  roots: true,  rootNameFilter: &quot;minusOne&quot;,  sourceFilter: -&amp;gt; (src) {    return src.name == Dir.pwd+&quot;/agent-fib.js&quot;  }})The above Ruby script example prints out value of variable n when a function minusOne in the agent-fib.js program is called:./bin/node --js.print --experimental-options --polyglot --insight=agent.rb agent-fib.jsminusOne 4minusOne 3minusOne 2minusOne 2Three is the result 3Insights with RThe same instrument can be written in the R language.Create the agent-r.R script:cat(&quot;R: Initializing GraalVM Insight scriptn&quot;)insight@on(&#39;source&#39;, function(env) {    cat(&quot;R: observed loading of &quot;, env$name, &quot;n&quot;)})cat(&quot;R: Hooks are ready!n&quot;)Use it to trace a test.R program:./bin/Rscript --insight=agent-r.R test.RR: Initializing GraalVM Insight scriptR: Hooks are ready!R: observed loading of test.RThe only change is the R language. All the other GraalVM Insight features and APIs remain the same.Insight into C CodeNot only it is possible to interpret dynamic languages, but with the help of the GraalVM’s LLI implementation, one can mix in even statically compiled programs written in C, C++, Fortran, Rust, etc.Take, for examle, a long running program like sieve.c, which contains never-ending for loop in main method. You would like to give it some execution quota.First, execute the program on GraalVM:export TOOLCHAIN_PATH=`.../bin/lli --print-toolchain-path`${TOOLCHAIN_PATH}/clang agent-sieve.c -lm -o sieve./bin/lli sieveThe GraalVM clang wrapper adds special options instructing the regular clang to keep the LLVM bitcode information in the sieve executable along the normal native code.The GraalVM’s lli interpreter can then use the bitcode to interpret the program at full speed.By the way, compare the result of direct native execution via ./sieve and interpreter speed of ./bin/lli sieve.It should show quite good results as for an interpreter.Now focus on breaking the endless loop. You can do it with this JavaScript agent-limit.js Insight script:var counter = 0;insight.on(&#39;enter&#39;, function(ctx, frame) {    if (++counter === 1000) {        throw `GraalVM Insight: ${ctx.name} method called ${counter} times. enough!`;    }}, {    roots: true,    rootNameFilter: &#39;nextNatural&#39;});The script counts the number of invocations of the C nextNatural function and when the function gets invoked a thousand times, it emits an error to terminate the sieve execution.Run the program as:./bin/lli --polyglot --insight=agent-limit.js sieveComputed 97 primes in 181 ms. Last one is 509GraalVM Insight: nextNatural method called 1000 times. enough!        at &amp;lt;js&amp;gt; :anonymous(&amp;lt;eval&amp;gt;:7:117-185)        at &amp;lt;llvm&amp;gt; nextNatural(agent-sieve.c:14:186-221)        at &amp;lt;llvm&amp;gt; nextPrime(agent-sieve.c:74:1409)        at &amp;lt;llvm&amp;gt; measure(agent-sieve.c:104:1955)        at &amp;lt;llvm&amp;gt; main(agent-sieve.c:123:2452)It is possible to access primitive local variables from the native code.Replace the above Insight script with:insight.on(&#39;enter&#39;, function(ctx, frame) {    print(`found new prime number ${frame.n}`);}, {    roots: true,    rootNameFilter: (n) =&amp;gt; n === &#39;newFilter&#39;});Print out a message everytime a new prime is added into the filter list:./bin/lli --polyglot --insight=agent-limit.js sieve | head -n 3found new prime number 2found new prime number 3found new prime number 5The mixture of lli, polyglot and GraalVM Insight opens enormous possibilities in tracing, controlling and interactive or batch debugging of native programs.Inspecting ValuesGraalVM Insight not only allows one to trace where the program execution is happening, but it also offers access to values of local variables and function arguments during execution.One can for example write instrument that shows a value of argument n in a function fib:insight.on(&#39;enter&#39;, function(ctx, frame) {   print(&#39;fib for &#39; + frame.n);}, {   roots: true,   rootNameFilter: &#39;fib&#39;});This instrument uses the second function argument frame to get access to values of local variables inside of every instrumented function.The above Insight script also uses rootNameFilter to apply its hook only to function named fib:function fib(n) {  if (n &amp;lt; 1) return 0;  if (n &amp;lt; 2) return 1;  else return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);}print(&quot;Two is the result &quot; + fib(3));When the instrument is stored in a fib-trace.js file and the actual code in fib.js, then invoking following command yields detailed information about the program execution and parameters passed between function invocations:./bin/node --js.print --experimental-options --insight=fib-trace.js fib.jsfib for 3fib for 2fib for 1fib for 0fib for 1Two is the result 2To summarise this section, GraalVM Insight is a useful tool for polyglot, language agnostic aspect oriented programming.Modifying Local VariablesNot only that GraalVM Insight can access local variables, but it can also modify them.Take, for example, this program summing an array:function plus(a, b) {  return a + b;}var sum = 0;[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].forEach((n) =&amp;gt; sum = plus(sum, n));print(sum);It prints out a number 45.Apply the following Insight script to “erase” non-even numbers before adding them:insight.on(&#39;enter&#39;, function zeroNonEvenNumbers(ctx, frame) {    if (frame.b % 2 === 1) {        frame.b = 0;    }}, {    roots: true,    rootNameFilter: &#39;plus&#39;});When launched with js --insight=erase.js sumarray.js, only the value 20 gets printed.GraalVM Insight enter and return hooks can only modify existing variables.They cannot introduce new ones.Attempts to do so yield an exception.Insight to a Specific LocationTo get to variables at a specific code location, the at object may have not only one of the mandatory source specifications:a sourcePath property with the regular expression matching the source file path, or sourceURI property with string representation of the source URI.There can also be an optional line and/or column specified. Let’s have a distance.js source file:(function(x, y) {    let x2 = x*x;    let y2 = y*y;    let d = Math.sqrt(x2 + y2);    for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; d; i++) {        // ...    }    return d;})(3, 4);Then we can apply following distance-trace.js insight script to get values of variables:insight.on(&#39;enter&#39;, function(ctx, frame) {    print(&quot;Squares: &quot; + frame.x2 + &quot;, &quot; + frame.y2);}, {    statements: true,    at: {        sourcePath: &quot;.*distance.js&quot;,        line: 4    }});insight.on(&#39;enter&#39;, function(ctx, frame) {    print(&quot;Loop var i = &quot; + frame.i);}, {    expressions: true,    at: {        sourcePath: &quot;.*distance.js&quot;,        line: 5,        column: 21    }});That gives us:./bin/js --insight=distance-trace.js distance.jsSquares: 9, 16Loop var i = 0Loop var i = 1Loop var i = 2Loop var i = 3Loop var i = 4Loop var i = 5Delaying Insight Initialization in Node.JSGraalVM Insight can be used in any GraalVM language runtime, including the node implementation.However, when in node, one does not want to write plain Insight scripts. You would proabably want to use full power of the node ecosystem including its modules.Here is a sample agent-require.js script that does it:let initialize = function (require) {    let http = require(&quot;http&quot;);    print(`${typeof http.createServer} http.createServer is available to the agent`);}let waitForRequire = function (event) {  if (typeof process === &#39;object&#39; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; process.mainModule &amp;amp;&amp;amp; process.mainModule.require) {    insight.off(&#39;source&#39;, waitForRequire);    initialize(process.mainModule.require.bind(process.mainModule));  }};insight.on(&#39;source&#39;, waitForRequire, { roots: true });The Insight scripts are initialized as soon as possible, and at that moment the require function is not yet ready.As such, the script first attaches a listener on loaded scripts and, when the main user script is being loaded, it obtains its process.mainModule.require function.Then it removes the probes using insight.off and invokes the actual initialize function to perform the real initialization while having access to all the node modules.The script can be run with:./bin/node --js.print --experimental-options --insight=agent-require.js yourScript.jsThis initialization sequence is known to work on GraalVM’s node version 12.10.0 launched with the main yourScript.js parameter.Handling ExceptionsThe GraalVM Insight instrument can throw exceptions which are then propagated to the surrounding user scripts.Imagine you have a program seq.js logging various messages:function log(msg) {    print(msg);}log(&#39;Hello GraalVM Insight!&#39;);log(&#39;How&#39;);log(&#39;are&#39;);log(&#39;You?&#39;);You can register an instrument term.js and terminate the execution in the middle of the seq.js program execution, based on observing the logged message:insight.on(&#39;enter&#39;, (ev, frame) =&amp;gt; {    if (frame.msg === &#39;are&#39;) {        throw &#39;great you are!&#39;;    }}, {    roots: true,    rootNameFilter: &#39;log&#39;});The term.js instrument waits for a call to log function with message are and, at that moment, it emits its own exception effectively interrupting the user program execution.As a result one gets:./bin/js --polyglot --insight=term.js seq.jsHello GraalVM Insight!Howgreat you are!        at &amp;lt;js&amp;gt; :=&amp;gt;(term.js:3:75-97)        at &amp;lt;js&amp;gt; log(seq.js:1-3:18-36)        at &amp;lt;js&amp;gt; :program(seq.js:7:74-83)The exceptions emitted by Insight instrument are treated as regular language exceptions.The seq.js program could use the regular try { ... } catch (e) { ... } block to catch them and deal with them as if they were emitted by the regular user code.Intercepting and Altering ExecutionGraalVM Insight is capable to alter the execution of a program.It can skip certain computations and replace them with own alternatives.The the following plus function as an example:function plus(a, b) {    return a + b;}It is easy to change the behavior of the plus method.The following Insight script replaces the + operation with multiplication by using the ctx.returnNow functionality:insight.on(&#39;enter&#39;, function(ctx, frame) {    ctx.returnNow(frame.a * frame.b);}, {    roots: true,    rootNameFilter: &#39;plus&#39;});The returnNow method immediatelly stops execution and returns to the caller of the plus function.The body of the plus method is not executed at all because the insight on(&#39;enter&#39;, ...) was applied, e.g., before the actual body of the function was executed.Multiplying instead of adding two numbers may not sound very tempting, but the same approach is useful in providing add-on caching (e.g., memoization) of repeating function invocations.It is also possible to let the original function code run and just alter its result.For example, alter the result of plus function to be always non-negative:insight.on(&#39;return&#39;, function(ctx, frame) {    let result = ctx.returnValue(frame);    ctx.returnNow(Math.abs(result));}, {    roots: true,    rootNameFilter: &#39;plus&#39;});The Insight hook is executed on return of the plus function and is using the returnValue helper function to obtain the computed return value from the current frame object.Then it can alter the value and returnNow returns a new result instead.The returnValue function is always available on the provided ctx object, but it only returns a meaningful value when used in on(&#39;return&#39;, ...) hooks.Minimal OverheadIf you ask whether GraalVM Insight causes any performance overhead when the scripts are applied, the answer is “No” or “Minimal”.The overhead depends on what your scripts do.When they add and spread complex computations all around your code base, then the price for the computation will be payed.However, that would be overhead of your code, not of the instrumentation.Using a simple function-count.js script, measure overhead.var count = 0;function dumpCount() {    print(`${count} functions have been executed`);}insight.on(&#39;enter&#39;, function(ev) {    count++;}, {    roots: true});insight.on(&#39;close&#39;, dumpCount);Use the script on fifty iterations of the sieve.js sample which uses a variant of the Sieve of Erathostenes to compute one hundred thousand of prime numbers.Repeating the computation fifty times gives the runtime a chance to warm up and properly optimize.Here is the optimal run:./bin/js sieve.js | grep -v ComputedHundred thousand prime numbers in 75 msHundred thousand prime numbers in 73 msHundred thousand prime numbers in 73 msNow compare it to execution time when running with the GraalVM Insight script enabled:./bin/js --insight=function-count.js sieve.js  | grep -v ComputedHundred thousand prime numbers in 74 msHundred thousand prime numbers in 74 msHundred thousand prime numbers in 75 ms72784921 functions have been executedThe difference is 2 milliseconds.GraalVM Insight blends the difference between application code and insight gathering scripts making all code work as one.The count++ invocation becomes a natural part of the application at all the places representing ROOT of application functions.Minimal Overhead when Accessing LocalsGraalVM Insight is capable to access local variables, almost “for free”.GraalVM Insight code, accessing local variables, blends with the actual function code defining them and there is no visible slowdown.This can be demonstrated with this sieve.js algorithm to compute hundred thousand of prime numbers.It keeps the found prime numbers in a linked list constructed via following function:function Filter(number) {    this.number = number;    this.next = null;    this.last = this;}First, test the behavior by invoking the computation fifty times and measuring time it takes to finish the last round:./bin/js -e &quot;var count=50&quot; --file sieve.js | grep Hundred | tail -n 1Hundred thousand prime numbers in 73 msThen “tease” the system by observing each allocation of a new prime number slot, e.g., the call to new Filter constructor:var sum = 0;var max = 0;insight.on(&#39;enter&#39;, (ctx, frame) =&amp;gt; {    sum += frame.number;    if (frame.number &amp;gt; max) {        max = frame.number;    }}, {  roots: true,  rootNameFilter: &#39;Filter&#39;});insight.on(&#39;return&#39;, (ctx, frame) =&amp;gt; {    log(`Hundred thousand prime numbers from 2 to ${max} has sum ${sum}`);    sum = 0;    max = 0;}, {    roots: true,    rootNameFilter: &#39;measure&#39;});Everytime a new Filter(number) is allocated, the maximum value of number is captured (e.g. the highest prime number found), and also sum of all prime numbers found so far.When the main loop in measure is over, e.g., there are hundred thousand prime numbers, the result is printed.Now try the following:./bin/js  -e &quot;var count=50&quot; --insight=sieve-filter1.js --file sieve.js | grep Hundred | tail -n 2Hundred thousand prime numbers from 2 to 1299709 has sum 62260698721Hundred thousand prime numbers in 74 msThere is no slowdown at all.GraalVM Insight, when combined with inlining algorithms of the GraalVM compiler, enables great instrumentation capabilities with almost no performance penalty.Accessing Execution StackThere is a way for GraalVM Insight to access the whole execution stack.The following code snippet shows how to do that:insight.on(&quot;return&quot;, function(ctx, frame) {  print(&quot;dumping locals&quot;);  ctx.iterateFrames((at, vars) =&amp;gt; {      for (let p in vars) {          print(`    at ${at.name} (${at.source.name}:${at.line}:${at.column}) ${p} has value ${vars[p]}`);      }  });  print(&quot;end of locals&quot;);}, {  roots: true});Whenever the Insight hook is triggered, it prints the current execution stack with name of the function, source.name, line and column.Moreover, it also prints values of all local vars at each frame.It is also possible to modify values of existing variables by assigning new values to them: vars.n = 42.Accessing the whole stack is flexible, but unlike access to locals in the current execution frame, it is not a fast operation, use it wisely, if you want your program to continue running at full speed.Heap DumpingGraalVM Insight can be used to snapshot a region of your program heap during the execution.Use the --heap.dump=/path/to/output.hprof option together with a regular --insight one.The Insight script will get access to heap object with the dump function.Place your hook whereever needed and at the right moment dump the heap:insight.on(&#39;return&#39;, (ctx, frame) =&amp;gt; {    heap.dump({        format: &#39;1.0&#39;,        depth: 50, // set max depth for traversing object references        events: [            {                stack : [                    {                        at : ctx, // location of dump sieve.js:73                        frame : {                            // assemble frame content as you want                            primes : frame.primes, // capture primes object                            cnt : frame.cnt, // capture cnt value                        },                        depth : 10 // optionally override depth to ten references                    }, // there can be more stack elements like this one                ]            },            // there can be multiple events like the previous one        ],    });    throw &#39;Heap dump written!&#39;;}, {    roots: true,    rootNameFilter: &#39;measure&#39;});Save the code snippet as a dump.js file.Get the sieve.js file and launch it as:./bin/js --insight=dump.js --heap.dump=dump.hprof --file sieve.jsA dump.hprof file is going to be created at the end of the measure function capturing the state of your program memory.Inspect the generated .hprof file with regular tools like VisualVM or NetBeans:The previous picture shows the heap dump taken at the end of the measure function in the sieve.js script.The function has just computed one hundred thousand (count available in variable cnt) prime numbers.The picture shows a linked list Filter holding prime numbers from 2 to 17.The rest of the linked list is hidden (only references up to depth 10 were requested) behind unreachable object.Last variable x shows the number of searched natural numbers to compute all the prime numbers.Heap Dumping CacheTo speed up the heap dumping process and optimize the resulting dump, it’s possible to enable a memory cache.Objects whose properties are not changed between dumps to the cache are stored only once, reducing the resulting heap dump size.Add e.g. --heap.cacheSize=1000 option to use a memory cache for 1000 events. By default, the cache is dumped to the file and cleared when full.That policy can be changed by --heap.cacheReplacement=lru option, which keeps the most recent dump events in the cache and drops the oldest ones whenthe cache size limit is reached.To flush the cache to the heap dump file, heap.flush() needs to be called explicitly.Note on GraalVM Insight APIThe compatibility of the GraalVM Insight API exposed via the insight object is implemented in a compatible way.The GraalVM Insight API can be found by this link.The insight object properties and functions is available as part of its javadoc.Future versions will add new features, but whatever has once been exposed, remains functional.If your script depends on some new feature, it may check version of the exposed API:print(`GraalVM Insight version is ${insight.version}`);New elements in the APIcarry associated @since tag to describe the minimimal version the associated functionality is available since.",

          "title": "Tracing with Insight",
          "content": "Tracing with InsightIt is possible to use the GraalVM Insight to implement smooth, declarative, ad hoc tracing via standard OpenTracing API.The traces can be added into running application and customized on the fly to extract the right information needed to investigate any misbehavior incident.The following examples will demonstrate the tracing capabilities with GraalVM Insight.To start, install the Jaeger’s client side instrumentation library for Node.js:./bin/npm install jaeger-client@3.17.1Now you can use the OpenTracing API provided by the jaeger-client module in your instrument agent.js via the tracer object (once it becomes available, it will discussed later in this guide):let initialize = function(tracer) {    var counter = 0;    insight.on(&#39;enter&#39;, function(ctx, frame) {        const args = frame.args;        if (&#39;request&#39; !== frame.type || args.length !== 2 || typeof args[0] !== &#39;object&#39; || typeof args[1] !== &#39;object&#39;) {            return;        }        const req = args[0];        const res = args[1];        const span = tracer.startSpan(&quot;request&quot;);        span.setTag(&quot;span.kind&quot;, &quot;server&quot;);        span.setTag(&quot;http.url&quot;, req.url);        span.setTag(&quot;http.method&quot;, req.method);        res.id = ++counter;        res.span = span;        console.log(`agent: handling #${res.id} request for ${req.url}`);    }, {        roots: true,        rootNameFilter: &#39;emit&#39;,        at: {            sourcePath: &#39;.*events.js&#39;        }    });    insight.on(&#39;return&#39;, function(ctx, frame) {        var res = frame[&#39;this&#39;];        if (res.span) {            res.span.finish();            console.log(`agent: finished #${res.id} request`);        } else {            //Caused, for example, by Tracer itself connecting to the Jaeger server        }    }, {        roots: true,        rootNameFilter: &#39;end&#39;,        at: {            sourcePath: &#39;.*_http_outgoing.js&#39;        }    });    console.log(&#39;agent: ready&#39;);};The system hooks into emit(&#39;request&#39;, ...) and res.end() functions which are used to initialize a response to an HTTP request and finish it.Because the res object is a dynamic JavaScript object, it is possible to add id and span attributes to it in the enter handler of the emit function from the source events.js.Then it is possible to use these attributes in the return handler of the end function.GraalVM Insight provides access to frame variables and their fields.As such, the instrument can read value of req.url or req.method and provide them as span.setTag values to the OpenTracing server.With this instrument, it is just a matter of being able to enable it at the right time.Check the Embedding Insight into Node.js Application section to see how to create an admin server and apply any trace scripts (including OpenTracing based ones) dynamically when needed.For purposes of this guide, something simpler will be used.Enable the instrument when the jaeger object is provided to it:let initializeJaeger = function (ctx, frame) {    insight.off(&#39;enter&#39;, initializeJaeger);    let jaeger = frame.jaeger;    var initTracer = jaeger.initTracer;    console.log(&#39;agent: Jaeger tracer obtained&#39;);    // See schema https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-node/blob/master/src/configuration.js#L37    var config = {      serviceName: &#39;insight-demo&#39;,      reporter: {        // Provide the traces endpoint. This forces the client to connect directly to the Collector and send        // spans over HTTP        collectorEndpoint: &#39;http://localhost:14268/api/traces&#39;,        // Provide username and password if authentication is enabled in the Collector        // username: &#39;&#39;,        // password: &#39;&#39;,      },      sampler: {          type : &#39;const&#39;,          param : 1      }    };    var options = {      tags: {        &#39;insight-demo.version&#39;: &#39;1.1.2&#39;,      },    //  metrics: metrics,      logger: console,      sampler: {          type : &#39;const&#39;,          param : 1      }    };    var tracer = initTracer(config, options);    initialize(tracer);};insight.on(&#39;return&#39;, initializeJaeger, {  roots: true,  rootNameFilter: &#39;jaegerAvailable&#39;});This instrument needs help from the main server script.Let the server.js obtain the jaeger-client module and pass it to the agent via the jaegerAvailable function.Then it creates a typical HTTP server.The content of server.js is:function jaegerAvailable(jaeger) {    console.log(&quot;Providing Jaeger object to the agent&quot;);}jaegerAvailable(require(&quot;jaeger-client&quot;));const http = require(&quot;http&quot;);const srv = http.createServer((req, res) =&amp;gt; {    console.log(`server: obtained request ${res.id}`);    setTimeout(() =&amp;gt; {        res.write(`OK# ${res.id}`);        console.log(`server: replied to request ${res.id}`);        res.end();    }, 5);});srv.listen(8080);With these two files you can launch the node application as well as the agent.But, first of all, start the Jaeger server:docker run -d --name jaeger -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HTTP_PORT=9411 -p 5775:5775/udp   -p 6831:6831/udp   -p 6832:6832/udp -p 5778:5778   -p 16686:16686   -p 14268:14268   -p 9411:9411 jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest./bin/node --insight=agent.js server.jsProviding Jaeger object to the agentagent: Jaeger tracer obtainedInitializing Jaeger Tracer with RemoteReporter and ConstSampler(always)agent: readyNow you can connect to the Jaeger UI available at http://localhost:16686/ and put the server under some load:ab -c 10 -n 10000 http://localhost:8080/The server prints to the console detailed information while handling the requests and the Jaeger UI fills with the traces:This completes the guide how to enhance a plain Node.js application with tracing.The traces remain separated in its own agent.js file and can be applied at start time (demonstrated here) or dynamically when needed.What to Read RextTo learn more about Insight and find some challenging tasks, go to the Insight Manual.",

          "title": "Truffle Interop 2.0",
          "content": "Truffle Interop 2.0This document is targeted at guest language and tool implementers.It is recommended to read the Truffle Library Tutorial first, before proceeding.MotivationIn Truffle Version 1.0 RC15 a new API called “Truffle Libraries” was introduced.Truffle Libraries allow users to use polymorphism with support for profiling/caching.With Interop 2.0 it is planned to use Truffle Libraries for the interoperability protocol.The current interoperability APIs are mature and well-tested and alreadyadopted by languages and tools.Here is a list of arguments why current interoperability APIs were changed and Interop 2.0 was introduced:  Footprint: In the current interop API every message send goes through a CallTarget and the arguments are boxed into an Object[]. This makes current interop inefficient for interpreter calls and it requires additional memory. Truffle Libraries use simple nodes and type-specialized call signatures that do not require argument array boxing or call targets.  Uncached dispatch: There is no way to execute current interop messages from the slow-path without allocating a temporary node. Truffle Libraries automatically generate an uncached version of every exported message. This allows the use of interop messages from slow-path/runtime without allocating any temporary data structures.  Reuse dispatch for multiple messages: In current interop, the dispatch to exported messages is repeated for each message that is sent. If multiple messages need to be sent and the receiver type becomes polymorphic, this produces bad code. Interop libraries instances can be specialized for input values. This allows users to do the dispatch once and invoke multiple messages without repeating the dispatch. This leads to more efficient code in polymorphic cases.  Support for default implementations: Current interop can only be used for implementations of TruffleObject. Truffle Libraries can be used with any receiver type. For example, it is possible to invoke the isExecutable message on primitive numbers and it just returns false.  Error proneness: There were some common issues with message resolutions that Truffle Libraries try to avoid by not making them possible, such as mixing up receiver types or implementing a wrong type check. The new assertion feature for Truffle Libraries allows specifying message specific assertions that allow verifying invariants, pre, and post-conditions.  Redundancy in documentation: Current interop documents the messages in the Message constant and in the ForeignAccess static accessor method. This leads to mostly redundant documentation. With Truffle interop, there is only one place for the documentation, which is the instance method in the library class.  Generality: Truffle Libraries can be used for language representation abstractions, since it is now efficient enough in terms of memory consumption and interpreter performance. The current interop API could not realistically be used that way because of this issue.  Address protocol issues: There are some design issues with the current interop API that interop 2.0 tries to address (see later).CompatibilityThe change from interop 1.0 to 2.0 was done in a compatible way.Therefore, the old interop should continue to work and adoption can be incremental.This means that if one language still calls using the old interop API and the other language has already adopted the new interop API, a compatibility bridge will map the APIs.If you are curious about how this works, look for the class DefaultTruffleObjectExports for new interop calls to old interop. And LegacyToLibraryNode for old interop calls to new interop. Note that using the compatibility bridge may cause performance regressions.That is why languages should migrate as early as possible.Interop Protocol ChangesInterop 2.0 comes with many protocol changes. This section is intended to provide rationales for these changes. For fully detailed reference documentation see the InteropLibrary Javadoc.Note: Every deprecated API describes its migration path in the Javadoc tagged by @deprecated.Replace IS_BOXED and UNBOX with Explicit TypesThere are some problems with the IS_BOXED/UNBOX design:  In order to find out if a value is of a particular type, e.g., a String, the value needs to be unboxed first. Unboxing may be an expensive operation leading to inefficient code just to check the type of a value.  The old API cannot be used for values that did not implement TruffleObject. Therefore, the handling of primitive numbers needed to be separated from the TruffleObject case, making the UNBOX design necessary to reuse existing code. Truffle Libraries support primitive receiver types.  The design of UNBOX relies on the specified set of primitive types that it returns. It is hard to introduce additional, new interop types this way, as language refers to the primitive types directly.The following new messages were introduced in InteropLibrary as a replacement:boolean isBoolean(Object)boolean asBoolean(Object)boolean isString(Object)String  asString(Object)boolean isNumber(Object)boolean fitsInByte(Object)boolean fitsInShort(Object)boolean fitsInInt(Object)boolean fitsInLong(Object)boolean fitsInFloat(Object)boolean fitsInDouble(Object)byte asByte(Object)short asShort(Object)int asInt(Object)long asLong(Object)float asFloat(Object)double asDouble(Object)The InteropLibrary specifies default implementations for the receiver types Boolean, Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double, Character, and String.This design is extendable to support new values like big numbers or a custom String abstraction as Java primitive types are no longer directly used.It is no longer recommended to use primitive types in specializations directly, as the set of interop primitive types may change in the future.Instead, always use the interop library to check for a particular type, e.g., use fitsInInt instead of instanceof Integer.By using the new messages it is possible to emulate the original UNBOX message like this:@Specialization(limit=&quot;5&quot;)Object doUnbox(Object value, @CachedLibrary(&quot;value&quot;) InteropLibrary interop) {    if (interop.isBoolean(value)) {      return interop.asBoolean(value);    } else if (interop.isString(value)) {      return interop.asString(value);    } else if (interop.isNumber(value)) {      if (interop.fitsInByte(value)) {        return interop.asByte(value);      } else if (interop.fitsInShort(value)) {        return interop.asShort(value);      } else if (interop.fitsInInt(value)) {        return interop.asInt(value);      } else if (interop.fitsInLong(value)) {        return interop.asLong(value);      } else if (interop.fitsInFloat(value)) {        return interop.asFloat(value);      } else if (interop.fitsInDouble(value)) {        return interop.asDouble(value);      }    }    throw UnsupportedMessageException.create();}Note: It is not recommended to unbox all primitive types like this.Instead a language should only unbox to the primitive types it actually uses.Ideally an unbox operation is not needed and the interop library is directly used to implement the operation, like this:@Specialization(guards = {                &quot;leftValues.fitsInLong(l)&quot;,                &quot;rightValues.fitsInLong(r)&quot;}, limit=&quot;5&quot;)long doAdd(Object l, Object r,             @CachedLibrary(&quot;l&quot;) InteropLibrary leftValues,             @CachedLibrary(&quot;r&quot;) InteropLibrary rightValues) {       return leftValues.asLong(l) + rightValues.asLong(r);}Explicit Namespaces for Array and Member ElementsThe generic READ and WRITE messages were originally designed with primarily JavaScript use-cases in mind.With the adoption of interop by more languages, it became apparent that there is a need for explicit namespaces for arrays and object members.Over time, the interpretation of READ and WRITE was changed to represent array accesses when used with numbers and object member accesses when used with strings.The HAS_SIZE message was reinterpreted as whether the value contains array elements with additional guarantees, e.g., that array elements were iterable between index 0 and size.For better interop between languages, there is a need for an explicit Hash/Map/Dictionary entry namespace.Originally it was intended to reuse the generic READ/WRITE namespace for this.For JavaScript, this was possible, as the dictionary and member namespaces were equivalent.Most languages, however, separate Map entries from Object members, which leads to ambiguous keys.It is not possible for the source language (the protocol implementer) to know how this conflict needs to be resolved.Instead, by having explicit namespaces we can let the target language (the protocol caller) decide how to resolve the ambiguity.For example, whether dictionary or member elements should take precedence can now be decided in the target language operation.The following interop messages were changed:READ, WRITE, REMOVE, HAS_SIZE, GET_SIZE, HAS_KEYS, KEYSThe updated protocol with separate member and array namespace in InteropLibrary looks like this:Object Namespace:hasMembers(Object)getMembers(Object, boolean)readMember(Object, String)writeMember(Object, String, Object)removeMember(Object, String)invokeMember(Object, String, Object...)Array Namespace:hasArrayElements(Object)readArrayElement(Object, long)getArraySize(Object)writeArrayElement(Object, long, Object)removeArrayElement(Object, long)Array access messages no longer throw UnknownIdentifierException; they instead throw InvalidArrayIndexException.This was a bug in the original design, where the accessed number needed to be converted to the identifier string in the UnknownIdentifierException.Replaced KeyInfo with Individual MessagesIn the previous section, we did not mention the KEY_INFO message.The KEY_INFO message was useful to query all properties of a member or array element.While this was a conveniently small API, it was often inefficient as it required the implementer to return all the key info properties.At the same time, it is rare that the caller really needed all key info properties. With Interop 2.0 we removed the KEY_INFO message.Instead, we introduced explicit messages for each namespace, to address this issue.Object Namespace:isMemberReadable(Object, String)isMemberModifiable(Object, String)isMemberInsertable(Object, String)isMemberRemovable(Object, String)isMemberInvocable(Object, String)isMemberInternal(Object, String)isMemberWritable(Object, String)isMemberExisting(Object, String)hasMemberReadSideEffects(Object, String)hasMemberWriteSideEffects(Object, String)Array Namespace:isArrayElementReadable(Object, long)isArrayElementModifiable(Object, long)isArrayElementInsertable(Object, long)isArrayElementRemovable(Object, long)isArrayElementWritable(Object, long)isArrayElementExisting(Object, long)Note: The array namespace no longer supports querying for read or write side-effects.These messages might be reintroduced but, at the moment, there was no use-case.Also, the array namespace does not allow invocations.Remove Return Type for TO_NATIVEThe TO_NATIVE message was renamed to toNative in the InteropLibrary with the difference that it no longer returns a value, but performs the native transition as a side-effect if supported by the receiver.This allows the caller of the message to simplify their code. No cases the toNative transition required to return a different value were found.The default behaviour of toNative was changed to not return any value.Minor ChangesThe following messages were mostly unchanged. The NEW message was renamed to instantiate to be consistent with isInstantiable.Message.IS_NULL         -&amp;gt; InteropLibrary.isNullMessage.EXECUTE         -&amp;gt; InteropLibrary.executeMessage.IS_INSTANTIABLE -&amp;gt; InteropLibrary.isInstantiableMessage.NEW             -&amp;gt; InteropLibrary.instantiateMessage.IS_EXECUTABLE   -&amp;gt; InteropLibrary.isExecutableMessage.EXECUTE         -&amp;gt; InteropLibrary.executeMessage.IS_POINTER      -&amp;gt; InteropLibrary.isPointerMessage.AS_POINTER      -&amp;gt; InteropLibrary.asPointerStronger AssertionsMany new assertions were introduced as part of the migration. The concrete pre-post and invariant conditions are described in the Javadoc. Unlike the old interop nodes, cached libraries can only be used when adopted as part of the AST.No More Unchecked/Checked ExceptionsWith Interop 2.0 InteropException.raise was deprecated.While possible, it is considered an anti-pattern to rethrow checked exceptions as unchecked exceptions.With Truffle Libraries the target language nodes are directly inserted into the AST of the caller so there is no longer a limiting CallTarget that does not support checked exceptions.Together with additional support for checked Exceptions from Truffle DSL, it should no longer be necessary to use the raise methods.Instead, a new create factory method was introduced for all interop exception types.It is planned to remove stack traces from interop exceptions in order to improve their efficiency, as interop exceptions are intended to be always immediately caught and never be rethrown.This was deferred until the compatibility layer can be removed.MigrationWith the use of Truffle Libraries for interop, most existing interop APIs had to be deprecated.The following comparison of Interop 1.0 with Interop 2.0 is designed to help migrate existing uses of interop.Fast-Path Sending Interop MessagesThis is the fast-path way of sending interop messages embedded in an operation node.This is the most common way of sending interop messages.Interop 1.0:@ImportStatic({Message.class, ForeignAccess.class})abstract static class ForeignExecuteNode extends Node {    abstract Object execute(Object function, Object[] arguments);    @Specialization(guards = &quot;sendIsExecutable(isExecutableNode, function)&quot;)    Object doDefault(TruffleObject function, Object[] arguments,                    @Cached(&quot;IS_EXECUTABLE.createNode()&quot;) Node isExecutableNode,                    @Cached(&quot;EXECUTE.createNode()&quot;) Node executeNode) {        try {            return ForeignAccess.sendExecute(executeNode, function, arguments);        } catch (UnsupportedTypeException | ArityException | UnsupportedMessageException e) {            // ... convert errors to guest language errors ...        }    }}Interop 2.0:abstract static class ForeignExecuteNode extends Node {    abstract Object execute(Object function, Object[] arguments);    @Specialization(guards = &quot;functions.isExecutable(function)&quot;, limit = &quot;2&quot;)    Object doDefault(Object function, Object[] arguments,                    @CachedLibrary(&quot;function&quot;) InteropLibrary functions) {        try {            return functions.execute(function, arguments);        } catch (UnsupportedTypeException | ArityException | UnsupportedMessageException e) {            // ... convert errors to guest language errors ...        }    }}Note the following differences:  To invoke messages we call instance methods on TruffleLibrary instead of calling a static method on ForeignAccess.  The old interop required the creation of one node for each operation. With the new version, only one specialized interop library is created.  In the old API we needed to specialize the receiver type for TruffleObject. The new interop library can be invoked with any interop value. By default isExecutable will return false for values that don’t export the interop library. E.g., it is now valid to call the library with boxed primitive receiver values.  Instead of using @Cached in the old interop, in the new interop we use @CachedLibrary.  The new @CachedLibrary annotation specifies the value the library specializes on. This allows the DSL to specialize the library instance to that value. This again allows the dispatch on the receiver value to be performed once for all message invocations. In the old interop version, the nodes could not be specialized to values. Therefore the dispatch needed to be repeated for every interop message send.  The specialized library instance requires specifying a limit for the specialization method. If this limit overflows, the uncached version of the library will be used that does not perform any profiling/caching. The old interop API assumed a constant specialization limit of 8 per interop node.  The new interop API allows for using a dispatched version of the library by specifying @CachedLibrary(limit=&quot;2&quot;) instead. This allows the interop library to be used with any value, but it has the disadvantage of duplicating the inline cache for every message invocation, like with the old interop API. It is therefore recommended to use specialized libraries whenever possible.Slow-Path Sending Interop MessagesIt is sometimes necessary to call interop messages from the runtime without the context of a node:Interop 1.0:ForeignAccess.sendRead(Message.READ.createNode(), object, &quot;property&quot;)Interop 2.0:InteropLibrary.getFactory().getUncached().read(object, &quot;property&quot;);Note the following differences:  The old interface allocated a node for each invocation.  The new library uses the uncached version of the library that does not require any allocation or boxing for each invocation.  With InteropLibrary.getFactory().getUncached(object) an uncached and specialized version of a library can be looked up. This can be used to avoid repeated export lookups if multiple uncached interop messages need to be sent to the same receiver.Custom Fast-Path Sending Interop MessagesSometimes Truffle DSL cannot be used and the nodes need to be written manually. Both APIs allow you to do so:Interop 1.0:final class ForeignExecuteNode extends Node {    @Child private Node isExecutableNode = Message.IS_EXECUTABLE.createNode();    @Child private Node executeNode = Message.EXECUTE.createNode();    Object execute(Object function, Object[] arguments) {        if (function instanceof TruffleObject) {            TruffleObject tFunction = (TruffleObject) function;            if (ForeignAccess.sendIsExecutable(isExecutableNode, tFunction)) {                try {                    return ForeignAccess.sendExecute(executeNode, tFunction, arguments);                } catch (UnsupportedTypeException | ArityException | UnsupportedMessageException e) {                    // TODO handle errors                }            }        }        // throw user error    }}Interop 2.0:static final class ForeignExecuteNode extends Node {    @Child private InteropLibrary functions = InteropLibrary.getFactory().createDispatched(5);    Object execute(Object function, Object[] arguments) {        if (functions.isExecutable(function)) {            try {                return functions.execute(function, arguments);            } catch (UnsupportedTypeException | ArityException | UnsupportedMessageException e) {                // handle errors                return null;            }        }        // throw user error    }}Note the following differences:  The new interop creates nodes through the LibraryFactory&amp;lt;InteropLibrary&amp;gt; accessible through InteropLibrary.getFactory(). The old interop creates dispatching nodes through the Message instance.  The dispatch limit can be specified for the new interop libraries. The old interop API always assumed a constant limit of 8.  For the new interop we do not need to check for the type TruffleObject as Truffle Libraries can be used with any receiver type. For non-function values, isExecutable will just return false.Implementing/Exporting Interop MessagesTo implement/export interop library messages, see the following example:Interop 1.0:@MessageResolution(receiverType = KeysArray.class)final class KeysArray implements TruffleObject {    private final String[] keys;    KeysArray(String[] keys) {        this.keys = keys;    }    @Resolve(message = &quot;HAS_SIZE&quot;)    abstract static class HasSize extends Node {        public Object access(KeysArray receiver) {            return true;        }    }    @Resolve(message = &quot;GET_SIZE&quot;)    abstract static class GetSize extends Node {        public Object access(KeysArray receiver) {            return receiver.keys.length;        }    }    @Resolve(message = &quot;READ&quot;)    abstract static class Read extends Node {        public Object access(KeysArray receiver, int index) {            try {                return receiver.keys[index];            } catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {                CompilerDirectives.transferToInterpreter();                throw UnknownIdentifierException.raise(String.valueOf(index));            }        }    }    @Override    public ForeignAccess getForeignAccess() {        return KeysArrayForeign.ACCESS;    }    static boolean isInstance(TruffleObject array) {        return array instanceof KeysArray;    }}Interop 2.0:@ExportLibrary(InteropLibrary.class)final class KeysArray implements TruffleObject {    private final String[] keys;    KeysArray(String[] keys) {        this.keys = keys;    }    @ExportMessage    boolean hasArrayElements() {        return true;    }    @ExportMessage    boolean isArrayElementReadable(long index) {        return index &amp;gt;= 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; index &amp;lt; keys.length;    }    @ExportMessage    long getArraySize() {        return keys.length;    }    @ExportMessage    Object readArrayElement(long index) throws InvalidArrayIndexException {        if (!isArrayElementReadable(index) {            throw InvalidArrayIndexException.create(index);        }        return keys[(int) index];    }}Note the following differences:  Instead of @MessageResolution we use @ExportLibrary.  Both versions need to implement TruffleObject. The new interop API only requires a TruffleObject type for compatibility reasons.  Instead of @Resolve, the @ExportMessage annotation is used. The latter annotation can infer the name of the message from the method name. If the method name is ambiguous, e.g., when multiple libraries are exported, then the name and library can be specified explicitly.  There is no need to specify classes for exports/resolves. However, it is still possible to do so if an export needs multiple specializations. See the Truffle Library tutorial for details.  Exceptions are now thrown as checked exceptions.  It is no longer needed to implement getForeignAccess(). The implementation discovers implementations for receiver types automatically.  It is no longer needed to implement isInstance. The implementation is now derived from the class signature. Note that the check can be more efficient if the receiver type is declared final. For non-final receiver types, it is recommended to specify exported methods as final.Integration with DynamicObjectThe old interop allowed for specifying a foreign access factory through ObjectType.getForeignAccessFactory(). This method is now deprecated and a new method, ObjectType.dispatch(), was introduced. Instead of a foreign access factory, the dispatch method needs to return a class that exports the InteropLibrary with an explicit receiver:Interop 1.0:public final class SLObjectType extends ObjectType {    public static final ObjectType SINGLETON = new SLObjectType();    private SLObjectType() {    }    public static boolean isInstance(TruffleObject obj) {        return SLContext.isSLObject(obj);    }    @Override    public ForeignAccess getForeignAccessFactory(DynamicObject obj) {        return SLObjectMessageResolutionForeign.ACCESS;    }}@MessageResolution(receiverType = SLObjectType.class)public class SLObjectMessageResolution {    @Resolve(message = &quot;WRITE&quot;)    public abstract static class SLForeignWriteNode extends Node {...}    @Resolve(message = &quot;READ&quot;)    public abstract static class SLForeignReadNode extends Node {...}    ...Interop 2.0:@ExportLibrary(value = InteropLibrary.class, receiverType = DynamicObject.class)public final class SLObjectType extends ObjectType {    public static final ObjectType SINGLETON = new SLObjectType();    private SLObjectType() {    }    @Override    public Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; dispatch() {        return SLObjectType.class;    }    @ExportMessage    static boolean hasMembers(DynamicObject receiver) {        return true;    }    @ExportMessage    static boolean removeMember(DynamicObject receiver, String member) throws UnknownIdentifierException {...}    // other exports omitted }Note the following differences:  The object type can be reused as the export class.  The isInstance method no longer needs to be specified.  The new interop requires specifying the receiver type to DynamicObject.Extending InteropThe languages implemented with Truffle rarely need to extend interop, but they might need to extend their own language specific protocol:Interop 1.0:  Add new KnownMessage subclass called FooBar.  Add a new method sendFooBar to ForeignAccess.  Add a new method to ForeignAccess.Factory: createFooBar.  Modify the interop annotation processor to generate the code for createFooBar.Interop 2.0:  Add a new method fooBar in InteropLibrary. Everything else is done automatically.",

          "content": "Interoperability with Truffle LanguagesJava on Truffle allows you to interface other “Truffle” languages (languages which interpreters are implemented with the Truffle framework) to create polyglot programs – programs written in more than one language.This guide describes how to load code written in foreign languages, how to export and import objects between languages, how to use Java on Truffle objects from a foreign language, how to use foreign objects from Java on Truffle, and how to embed in host Java.To avoid confusion, the terms host and guest are used to differentiate the different layers where Java is executed. Java on Truffle refers to the guest layer.You pass polyglot options to the java -truffle launcher.If you are using the native configuration, you will need to use the --polyglot flag to get access to other languages.Foreign objects must “inhabit” a guest Java type when flowing into Java on Truffle.How this type is attached to foreign objects is an implementation detail.PolyglotJava on Truffle provides a guest Java Polyglot API, described in polyglot.jar.This JAR is automatically injected on guest Java contexts but can be excluded with --java.Polyglot=false.You can import the Polyglot class to interact with other guest languages:// guest javaimport com.oracle.truffle.espresso.polyglot.Polyglot;int two = Polyglot.eval(int.class, &quot;js&quot;, &quot;1+1&quot;);You can determine if an object is foreign:// guest javaObject foreign = Polyglot.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;[2, 0, 2, 1]&quot;);Object local = new int[]{2, 0, 2, 1};System.out.println(Polyglot.isForeignObject(foreign)); // prints trueSystem.out.println(Polyglot.isForeignObject(local));   // prints falseYou can cast foreign objects to guest Java types:// guest javaObject foreignArray = Polyglot.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;[&#39;a string&#39;, 42, 3.14159, null]&quot;);Object[] objects = Polyglot.cast(Object[].class, foreignArray);assert objects.length == 4;String elem0 = Polyglot.cast(String.class, objects[0]);   // eager conversionInteger elem1 = Polyglot.cast(Integer.class, objects[1]); // preserves identityint elem1_ = Polyglot.cast(int.class, objects[1]);        // eager conversiondouble elem2 = Polyglot.cast(double.class, objects[2]);   // eager conversionObject elem3 = objects[3];assert elem3 == null;The Polyglot.cast(targetClass, obj) method is an augmented Java cast, e.g., targetClass.cast(obj):  Java cast succeeds ⇒ Polyglot.cast succeeds.  Java cast does not succeeds, Polyglot.cast can “re-type” foreign objects, e.g., to cast to Integer, the foreign object must fitsInInt.

Please refer to more details in a dedicated section below.*Java on Truffle does not support evaluation (.eval) of Java sources.In Java, methods can be overloaded, e.g., several methods can share the same name, with different signatures.To remove ambiguity, Java on Truffle allows to specify the method descriptor in the methodName/methodDescriptor form:// host javaValue java_lang_String = polyglot.getBindings(&quot;java&quot;).getMember(&quot;java.lang.String&quot;);// String#valueOf(int)String valueOf = String.format(&quot;%s/%s&quot;, &quot;valueOf&quot;, &quot;(I)Ljava/lang/String;&quot;);Value fortyTwo = java_lang_String.invokeMember(valueOf, 42);assert &quot;42&quot;.equals(fortyTwo.asString());Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; instance vs. static class accessor (Klass):The static class accessor allows to access (public) static fields and call (public) static methods.// Class loading through language bindings return the static class accessor.Value java_lang_Number = polyglot.getBindings(&quot;java&quot;).getMember(&quot;java.lang.Number&quot;);Value java_lang_Class = polyglot.getBindings(&quot;java&quot;).getMember(&quot;java.lang.Class&quot;);// Class#forName(String) returns the Class&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; instance.Value integer_class = java_lang_Class.invokeMember(&quot;forName&quot;, &quot;java.lang.Integer&quot;);// Static class accessor to Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; instance and viceversa.assert integer_class.equals(java_lang_Integer.getMember(&quot;class&quot;));assert java_lang_Integer.equals(integer_class.getMember(&quot;static&quot;));// Get Integer super class.assert java_lang_Number.equals(java_lang_Integer.getMember(&quot;super&quot;));Converting host objects to guest types using type convertersSince version 22.3.0 Java on Truffle has built-in support for declaring type conversion of host objects to proper guest-typed objects. This is done via context builder options as described above. The main idea is to allow transparent flow of objects from host to guest without having to perform guest type checks when host objects enter an embedded Java on Truffle context. Specifically the follwoing options can be set to control type conversion for an embedded context:java.PolyglotTypeConvertersThis option takes precedence over java.PolyglotInterfaceMappings and thus, if a dedicated type converter function is defined, no other automatic interface mapping proxies are generated by Java on Truffle.Note: Declared type converters must implement the GuestTypeConversion interface located in the com.oracle.truffle.espresso.polyglot package in polyglor.jar.package com.oracle.truffle.espresso.polyglot;public interface GuestTypeConversion&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; {    T toGuest(Object polyglotInstance);}For each type converter declared use one option call like this:// host javaContext polyglot = Context.newBuilder().allowAllAccess(true).        option(&quot;java.PolyglotTypeConverters.java.math.BigDecimal&quot;, &quot;guest.context.path.BigDecimalConverter&quot;).        build();...// guest javapackage guest.context.path;import com.oracle.truffle.espresso.polyglot.GuestTypeConversion;import com.oracle.truffle.espresso.polyglot.Interop;import com.oracle.truffle.espresso.polyglot.InteropException;import java.math.BigDecimal;public class BigDecimalConverter implements GuestTypeConversion&amp;lt;BigDecimal&amp;gt; {    @Override    @SuppressWarnings(&quot;unchecked&quot;)    public BigDecimal toGuest(Object polyglotInstance) {        try {            return new BigDecimal(Interop.asString(Interop.invokeMember(polyglotInstance, &quot;toString&quot;)));        } catch (InteropException e) {            throw new ClassCastException(&quot;polyglot instance cannot be cast to java.math.BigDecimal&quot;);        }    }}The java.math.Bigdecimal part of the option declares the fully qualified meta name of a host object entering Java on Truffle.java.PolyglotInterfaceMappingsIf there are no dedicated java.PolyglotTypeConverters for a host object flowing into an embedded Java on Truffle context, automatic interface type mapping kicks in. java.PolyglotInterfaceMappings enables seamless interface type sharing between the host and the embedded context.The following example shows how this option can be used to allow passing common JDK collection types by interface to an embedded Java on Truffle context:// host javabuilder.option(&quot;java.PolyglotInterfaceMappings&quot;, getInterfaceMappings());private static String getInterfaceMappings(){    return &quot;java.lang.Iterable;&quot;+    &quot;java.util.Collection;&quot;+    &quot;java.util.List;&quot;+    &quot;java.util.Set;&quot;+    &quot;java.util.Map;&quot;+    &quot;java.util.Iterator;&quot;+    &quot;java.util.Spliterator;&quot;;}MultithreadingJava on Truffle is designed to be a multi-threaded language and much of the ecosystem expects threads to be available.This may be incompatible with other Truffle languages which do not support threading, so you can disable the creation of multiple threads with the option --java.MultiThreaded=false.When this option is enabled, finalizers will not run, neither the ReferenceQueue notification mechanism.Both these features would require starting new threads. Note that the garbage-collection of weakly reachable objects remains unaffected.Instead, reference processing can be manually triggered through a special command, only available in single-threaded environments.// Host Java// Will trigger Reference processing and run finalizerspolyglot.eval(&quot;java&quot;, &quot;&amp;lt;ProcessReferences&amp;gt;&quot;);Note that this command might trigger arbitrary cleaner and finalizer code. As such, this should ideally be run with as few guest java frames on the stack as possible.",

This string was matched by Graal.js&quot;)assert &quot;Graal.js&quot; in md[1]    This program matches Python strings using the JavaScript regular expression object. Python reads the captured group from the JavaScript result and checks for a substring in it.  Exporting Python Objects to other LanguagesThe polyglot module can be used to expose Python objects to JVM languages and other Graal languages (languages implemented on the Truffle framework).  You can export some object from Python to other languages so they can import it:    import sslpolyglot.export_value(value=ssl, name=&quot;python_ssl&quot;)    Then use it in (for example) from JavaScript code:    Polyglot.import(&#39;python_ssl).get_server_certificate([&quot;oracle.com&quot;, 443])    You can decorate a Python function to export it by name:    @polyglot.export_valuedef python_method():    return &quot;Hello from Python!&quot;    Then use it (for example) from Java code:    import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;class Main {    public static void main(String[] args) {        try (var context = Context.create()) {            context.eval(Source.newBuilder(&quot;python&quot;, &quot;file:///python_script.py&quot;).build());            String result = context.                getPolyglotBindings().                getMember(&quot;python_method&quot;).                execute().                asString();            assert result.equals(&quot;Hello from Python!&quot;);        }    } }  Mapping Types between Python and Other LanguagesThe interop protocol defines different “types” which can overlap in all kinds of ways and have restrictions on how they can interact with Python.Interop Types to PythonMost importantly and upfront: all foreign objects passed into Python have the Python type foreign.There is no emulation of (for example) objects that are of interop type “boolean” to have the Python type bool.This is because interop types can overlap in ways that the Python built-in types cannot, and we have yet to define which type should take precedence and such situations.We do expect to change this in the future, however.For now, the foreign type defines all of the Python special methods for type conversion that are used throughout the interpreter (methods such as __add__, __int__, __str__, __getitem__, and so on)and these try to “do the right thing” based on the interop type (or raise an exception).Types not listed in the table below have no special interpretation in Python.            Interop Type      Python Interpretation                  null      null is like None. Important to know: interop null values are all identical to None. JavaScript defines two “null-like” values; undefined and null, which are not identical, but when passed to Python, they are treated so.              boolean      boolean behaves like Python booleans, including the fact that in Python, all booleans are also integers (1 and 0 for true and false, respectively).              number      number Behaves like Python numbers. Python only has one integer and one floating point type, but ranges are imported in some places such as typed arrays.              string      Behaves in the same way as a Python string.              buffer      Buffers are also a concept in Python’s native API (albeit slightly different). Interop buffers are treated in the same was as Python buffers in some places (such as memoryview) to avoid copies of data.              array      An array can be used with subscript access in the same way as Python lists, with integers and slices as indices.              hash      A hash can be used with subscript access in the same way as Python dictionaries, with any “hashable” object as a key. “Hashable” follows Python semantics: generally every interop type with an identity is deemed “hashable”. Note that if an interop object is of type Array and Hash, the behavior of subscript access is undefined.              members      An object of type members can be read using conventional Python . notation or getattr and related functions.              iterable      An iterable is treated in the same way as any Python object with an __iter__ method. That is, it can be used in a loop and other places that accept Python iterables.              iterator      An iterator is treated in the same way as any Python object with a __next__ method.              exception      An exception can be caught in a generic except clause.              MetaObject      Meta objects can be used in subtype and isinstance checks.              executable      An executable object can be executed as a function, but never with keyword arguments.              instantiable      An instantiable object can be called just like a Python type, but never with keyword arguments.      Python to Interop Types            Interop Type      Python Interpretation                  null      Only None.              boolean      Only subtypes of Python bool. Note that in contrast to Python semantics, Python bool is never also an interop number.              number      Only subtypes of int and float.              string      Only subtypes of str.              array      Any object with __getitem__ and __len__ methods, but not if it also has keys, values, and items methods (in the same way that dict does.)              hash      Only subtypes of dict.              members      Any Python object. Note that the rules for readable/writable are a bit ad-hoc, since checking that is not part of the Python MOP.              iterable      Any Python object that has __iter__ or a __getitem__ methods.              iterator      Any Python object with a __next__ method.              exception      Any Python BaseException subtype.              MetaObject      Any Python type.              executable      Any Python object  with a __call__ method.              instantiable      Any Python type.      The Interoperability Extension APIIt is possible to extend the interoperability protocol directly from Python via a simple API defined in the polyglot module. The purpose of this API is to enable custom / user defined types to take part in the interop ecosystem. This is particularly useful for external types which are not compatible by default with the interop protocol. An example in this sense are the numpy numeric types (for example, numpy.int32) which are not supported by default by the interop protocol.The API            Function      Description                  register_interop_behavior      Takes the receiver type as first argument. The remainder keyword arguments correspond to the respective interop messages. Not All interop messages are supported.              get_registered_interop_behavior      Takes the receiver type as first argument. Returns the list of extended interop messages for the given type.              @interop_behavior      Class decorator, takes the receiver type as only argument. The interop messages are extended via static methods defined in the decorated class (supplier).      Supported messagesThe majority (with some exceptions) of the interop messages are supported by the interop behavior extension API, as shown in the table below.The naming convention for the register_interop_behavior keyword arguments follows the snake_case naming convention, i.e. the interop fitsInLong message becomes fits_in_long and so on. Each message can be extended with a pure python function (default keyword arguments, free vars and cell vars are not allowed) or a boolean constant. The table below describes the supported interop messages:            Message      Extension argument name      Expected return type                  isBoolean      is_boolean      bool              isDate      is_date      bool              isDuration      is_duration      bool              isIterator      is_iterator      bool              isNumber      is_number      bool              isString      is_string      bool              isTime      is_time      bool              isTimeZone      is_time_zone      bool              isExecutable      is_executable      bool              fitsInBigInteger      fits_in_big_integer      bool              fitsInByte      fits_in_byte      bool              fitsInDouble      fits_in_double      bool              fitsInFloat      fits_in_float      bool              fitsInInt      fits_in_int      bool              fitsInLong      fits_in_long      bool              fitsInShort      fits_in_short      bool              asBigInteger      as_big_integer      int              asBoolean      as_boolean      bool              asByte      as_byte      int              asDate      as_date      3-tuple with the following elements: (year: int, month: int, day: int)              asDouble      as_double      float              asDuration      as_duration      2-tuple with the following elements: (seconds: long, nano_adjustment: long)              asFloat      as_float      float              asInt      as_int      int              asLong      as_long      int              asShort      as_short      int              asString      as_string      str              asTime      as_time      4-tuple with the following elements:  (hour: int, minute: int, second: int, microsecond: int)              asTimeZone      as_time_zone      a string (the timezone) or int (utc delta in seconds)              execute      execute      object              readArrayElement      read_array_element      object              getArraySize      get_array_size      int              hasArrayElements      has_array_elements      bool              isArrayElementReadable      is_array_element_readable      bool              isArrayElementModifiable      is_array_element_modifiable      bool              isArrayElementInsertable      is_array_element_insertable      bool              isArrayElementRemovable      is_array_element_removable      bool              removeArrayElement      remove_array_element      NoneType              writeArrayElement      write_array_element      NoneType              hasIterator      has_iterator      bool              hasIteratorNextElement      has_iterator_next_element      bool              getIterator      get_iterator      a python iterator              getIteratorNextElement      get_iterator_next_element      object              hasHashEntries      has_hash_entries      bool              getHashEntriesIterator      get_hash_entries_iterator      a python iterator              getHashKeysIterator      get_hash_keys_iterator      a python iterator              getHashSize      get_hash_size      int              getHashValuesIterator      get_hash_values_iterator      a python iterator              isHashEntryReadable      is_hash_entry_readable      bool              isHashEntryModifiable      is_hash_entry_modifiable      bool              isHashEntryInsertable      is_hash_entry_insertable      bool              isHashEntryRemovable      is_hash_entry_removable      bool              readHashValue      read_hash_value      object              writeHashEntry      write_hash_entry      NoneType              removeHashEntry      remove_hash_entry      NoneType      Usage ExampleA simple register_interop_behavior API is available to register interop behaviors for existing types:import polyglotimport numpypolyglot.register_interop_behavior(numpy.int32,    is_number=True,    fitsInByte=lambda v: -128 &amp;lt;= v &amp;lt;

          "content": "InteroperabilityGraalVM supports several other programming languages including JavaScript, Ruby, Python, and those that compile to LLVM bitcode.GraalVM’s R runtime provides an API for programming language interoperability that lets you execute code from any other GraalVM-supported language.Note that you must start the R script with --polyglot to have access to other languages.GraalVM’s R runtime allows the following interoperability primitives:  eval.polyglot(&#39;languageId&#39;, &#39;code&#39;) evaluates code in some other language. The languageId can be, e.g., js.  eval.polyglot(path = &#39;/path/to/file.extension&#39;) evaluates code loaded from a file. The language is recognized from the extension.  export(&#39;polyglot-value-name&#39;, rObject) exports an R object so that it can be imported by other languages.  import(&#39;exported-polyglot-value-name&#39;) imports a polyglot value exported by some other language.Use the ?functionName syntax to learn more. The following example demonstrates the interoperability features:# get an array from Rubyx &amp;lt;- eval.polyglot(&#39;ruby&#39;, &#39;[1,2,3]&#39;)print(x[[1]])# [1] 1# get a JavaScript objectx &amp;lt;- eval.polyglot(path=&#39;r_example.js&#39;)print(x$a)# [1] &quot;value&quot;# use R vector in JavaScriptexport(&#39;robj&#39;, c(1,2,3))eval.polyglot(&#39;js&#39;, paste0(    &#39;rvalue = Polyglot.import(&quot;robj&quot;); &#39;,    &#39;console.log(&quot;JavaScript: &quot; + rvalue.length);&#39;))# JavaScript: 3# NULL -- the return value of eval.polyglot(Uses r_example.js.)R vectors are presented as arrays to other languages.This includes single element vectors, e.g., 42L or NA.However, single element vectors that do not contain NA can be typically used in places where the other languages expect a scalar value.An array subscript or similar operation can be used in other languages to access individual elements of an R vector.If the element of the vector is not NA, the actual value is returned as a scalar value, e.g., int.If the element is NA, then a special object that looks like null is returned.The following Ruby code demonstrates this:vec = Polyglot.eval(&quot;R&quot;, &quot;c(NA, 42)&quot;)p vec[0].nil?# truep vec[1]# 42vec = Polyglot.eval(&quot;R&quot;, &quot;42&quot;)p vec.to_s# &quot;[42]&quot;p vec[0]# 42The foreign objects passed to R are implicitly treated as specific R types.The following table gives some examples:            Example of foreign object (Java)      Viewed ‘as if’ on the R side                  int[] {1,2,3}      c(1L,2L,3L)              int[][] { {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 3} }      matrix(c(1:3,1:3),nrow=3)              int[][] { {1, 2, 3}, {1, 3} }      not supported: raises error              Object[] {1, ‘a’, ‘1’}      list(1L, ‘a’, ‘1’)              42      42L      In the following example, we can simply pass the Ruby array to the R built-in function sum, which will work with the Ruby array as if it was an integer vector.sum(eval.polyglot(&#39;ruby&#39;, &#39;[1,2,3]&#39;))Foreign objects can be also explicitly wrapped into adapters that make them look like the desired R type.In such a case, no data copying occurs, if possible.The code snippet below shows the most common use cases:# gives list instead of an integer vectoras.list(eval.polyglot(&#39;ruby&#39;, &#39;[1,2,3]&#39;))# assume the following Java code:# public class ClassWithArrays {#   public boolean[] b = {true, false, true};#   public int[] i = {1, 2, 3};# }x &amp;lt;- new(&#39;ClassWithArrays&#39;); # see Java interop belowas.list(x)# gives: list(c(T,F,T), c(1L,2L,3L))For more details, refer to the executable specification of the implicit and explicit foreign objects conversions.Note: R contexts started from other languages, or Java (as opposed to via the R script), will default to non interactive mode, similar to Rscript.This has implications on console output (the results are not echoed) and graphics (the output defaults to a file instead of a window), and some packages may behave differently in non-interactive mode.Bellow is a list of available R interoperability builtin functions.For more information see the R --help message and try these examples:&amp;gt; help(java.type)&amp;gt; ?java.type&amp;gt; example(java.type)  java.type  java.addToClasspath  is.polyglot.value  eval.polyglot  export  importSee the Polyglot Programming reference for more information about interoperability with other programming languages.",

          "title": "JCA Security Services in Native Image",
          "content": "JCA Security Services in Native ImageThis page explains Native Image support of the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) framework.The JCA framework uses a provider architecture to access security services such as digital signatures, message digests, certificates and certificate validation, encryption (symmetric/asymmetric block/stream ciphers), key generation and management, and secure random number generation, etc.To achieve algorithm independence and extensibility it relies on reflection, therefore it requires a custom configuration in Native Image.By default the native-image builder uses static analysis to discover which of these services are used (see next section for details).The automatic registration of security services can be disabled with -H:-EnableSecurityServicesFeature.Then a custom reflection configuration file or feature can be used to register the security services required by a specific application.Note that when automatic registration of security providers is disabled, all providers are, by default, filtered from special JDK caches that are necessary for security functionality.In this case, you must manually mark used providers with -H:AdditionalSecurityProviders.Security Services Automatic RegistrationThe mechanism, implemented in the com.oracle.svm.hosted.SecurityServicesFeature class, uses reachability of specific API methods in the JCA framework to determine which security services are used.Each JCA provider registers concrete implementation classes for the algorithms it supports.Each of the service classes (Signature, Cipher, Mac, KeyPair, KeyGenerator, KeyFactory, KeyStore, etc.) declares a series of getInstance(&amp;lt;algorithm&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;provider&amp;gt; factory methods which provide a concrete service implementation.When a specific algorithm is requested, the framework searches the registered providers for the corresponding implementation classes and dynamically allocates objects for concrete service implementations.The native-image builder uses static analysis to discover which of these services are used.It does so by registering reachability handlers for each of the getInstance() factory methods.When it determines that a getInstance() method is reachable at run time, it automatically performs the reflection registration for all the concrete implementations of the corresponding service type.Tracing of the security services automatic registation can be enabled with -H:+TraceSecurityServices.The report will detail all registered service classes, the API methods that triggered registration, and the parsing context for each reachable API method.  Note: The --enable-all-security-services option is now deprecated and it will be removed in a future release.Provider RegistrationThe native-image builder captures the list of providers and their preference order from the underlying JVM.The provider order is specified in the java.security file under &amp;lt;java-home&amp;gt;/lib/security/java.security.New security providers cannot be registered at run time; all providers must be statically configured at executable build time.Providers Reordering at Run TimeIt is possible to reorder security providers at run time, however only existing provider instances can be used.For example, if the BouncyCastle provider is registered at build time and you want to insert it at position 1 at run time:Provider bcProvider = Security.getProvider(&quot;BC&quot;);Security.removeProvider(&quot;BC&quot;);Security.insertProviderAt(bcProvider, 1);SecureRandomThe SecureRandom implementations open the /dev/random and /dev/urandom files which are used as sources.These files are usually opened in class initializers.To avoid capturing state from the machine that runs the native-image builder, these classes need to be initialized at run time.Custom Service TypesBy default, only services specified in the JCA framework are automatically registered. To automatically register custom service types, you can use the -H:AdditionalSecurityServiceTypes option.Note that for automatic registration to work, the service interface must have a getInstance method and have the same name as the service type.If relying on the third-party code that does not comply to the above requirements, a manual configuration will be required. In that case, providers for such services must explicitly be registered using the -H:AdditionalSecurityProviders option. Note that these options are only required in very specific cases and should not normally be needed.Further Reading  URL Protocols in Native Image  Jipher JCE with Native Image",

          "content": "JDK Flight Recorder (JFR) with Native ImageJDK Flight Recorder (JFR) is an event recorder for capturing information about a JVM, and an application running on the JVM. GraalVM Native Image supports building a native executable with JFR events, and users can use jdk.jfr.Event API with a similar experience to using JFR in the Java HotSpot VM.To record JFR events when running a native executable, JFR support and JFR recording must be enabled.Add JFR Support and Record Events at Run TimeTo build a native executable with the JFR events support, you first need to include JFR at build time, then enable the system, start a recording, and configure logging at native executable run time.To build a native executable with JFR, use the --enable-monitoring=jfr flag:native-image --enable-monitoring=jfr JavaApplicationTo enable the system, start a recording, and configure logging at run time, the following options are supported:  -XX:+FlightRecorder: use to enable JFR  -XX:StartFlightRecording: use to start a recording on application’s startup  -XX:FlightRecorderLogging: use to configure the log output for the JFR systemTo enable JFR and start a recording, simply use -XX:StartFlightRecording. For example:./javaapplication -XX:StartFlightRecording=&quot;filename=recording.jfr&quot;Run a DemoTransform this very simple demo application into a native image and see how to use JFR events from it.Save the following code to the Example.java file.import jdk.jfr.Event;import jdk.jfr.Description;import jdk.jfr.Label;public class Example {  @Label(&quot;Hello World&quot;)  @Description(&quot;Helps programmer getting started&quot;)  static class HelloWorldEvent extends Event {      @Label(&quot;Message&quot;)      String message;  }  public static void main(String... args) {      HelloWorldEvent event = new HelloWorldEvent();      event.message = &quot;hello, world!&quot;;      event.commit();  }}You can further configure the JFR recording or enable logging.Configure JFR RecordingYou can configure the JFR recording by passing a comma-separated list of key-value pairs to the -XX:StartFlightRecording option.For example:-XX:StartFlightRecording=&quot;filename=recording.jfr,dumponexit=true,duration=10s&quot;The following key-value pairs are supported:            Name      Default Value      Description                  name      none      Name that can be used to identify the recording, e.g., “name=MyRecording”              settings      none      Settings file (profile.jfc, default.jfc, etc.), e.g., “settings=myprofile.jfc”              delay      none      Delay recording start with (s)econds, (m)inutes), (h)ours), or (d)ays, e.g., “delay=5h”              duration      infinite (0)      Duration of recording in (s)econds, (m)inutes, (h)ours, or (d)ays, e.g., “duration=300s”              filename      none      Resulting recording filename, e.g., “filename=recording1.jfr”              maxage      no limit (0)      Maximum time to keep the recorded data on disk in (s)econds, (m)inutes, (h)ours, or (d)ays, e.g., 60m, or 0 for no limit. For example, “maxage=1d”              maxsize      no limit (0)      Maximum amount of bytes to keep on disk in (k)B, (M)B or (G)B, e.g., 500M, or 0 for no limit. For example, “maxsize=1G”              dumponexit      false      Whether to dump a running recording when the JVM shuts down, e.g., “dumponexit=true”      Configure JFR System LoggingYou can configure the logging for the JFR system with a separate flag -XX:FlightRecorderLogging. The usage is: -XX:FlightRecorderLogging=[tag1[+tag2...][*][=level][,...]]. For example:-XX:FlightRecorderLogging=jfr,system=debug-XX:FlightRecorderLogging=all=trace-XX:FlightRecorderLogging=jfr*=error  When this option is not set, logging is enabled at a level of WARNING.  When this option is set to an empty string, logging is enabled at a level of INFO.  When this option is set to “disable”, logging is disabled entirely.Available log levels are: trace, debug, info, warning, error, off.Available log tags are: all, jfr, system, event, setting, bytecode, parser, metadata, dcmd.Otherwise, this option expects a comma separated list of tag combinations, each with an optional wildcard (*) and level.  A tag combination without a level is given a default level of INFO.  Messages with tags that match a given tag combination will be logged if they meet the tag combination’s level.  If a tag combination does not have a wildcard, then only messages with exactly the same tags are matched. Otherwise, messages whose tags are a subset of the tag combination are matched.  If more than one tag combination matches a message’s tags, the rightmost one will apply.  Messages with tags that do not have any matching tag combinations are set to log at a default level of WARNING.  This option is case insensitive.Related Documentation  Debugging and DiagnosticsCurrent LimitationsJFR support is currently incomplete: for example, few VM-internal events are present. However, JFR currently includes the following features: custom and system events, disk-based recordings, and stack traces. To see an exhaustive list of JFR events and features supported by Native Image, see this GitHub issue.  Note: the GraalVM distribution for Windows does not include JFR event recording.Further Reading      Practice how to enable JFR support with Native Image and record events at run time using a demo application.

          "title": "Java Native Interface (JNI) in Native Image",
          "content": "Java Native Interface (JNI) in Native ImageJava Native Interface (JNI) is a native API that enables Java code to interact with native code and vice versa.This page gives an overview of the JNI implementation in Native Image.JNI support is enabled by default and built into Native Image. Individual classes, methods, and fields that should be accessible via JNI must be specified at image build time in a configuration file (read below).Java code can load native code from a shared object with System.loadLibrary().Alternatively, native code can load the JVM’s native library and attach to its Java environment using the Invocation API.The Native Image JNI implementation supports both approaches.Table of Contents  Loading Native Libraries  Reflection Metadata  Object Handles  Java-to-Native Method Calls  Native-to-Java Method Calls  JNI Functions  Object Creation  Field Accesses  Exceptions  MonitorsLoading Native LibrariesWhen loading native libraries using System.loadLibrary() (and related APIs), the native image will search the directory containing the native image before searching the Java library path. So as long as the native libraries to be loaded are in the same directory as the native image, no other settings should be necessary.Reflection MetadataJNI supports looking up classes by their names, and looking up methods and fields by their names and signatures.This requires keeping the necessary metadata for these lookups around.The native-image builder must know beforehand which items will be looked up in case they might not be reachable otherwise and therefore would not be included in a native image.Moreover, native-image must generate wrapper code ahead-of-time for any method that can be called via JNI.Therefore, specifying a concise list of items that need to be accessible via JNI guarantees their availability and allows for a smaller footprint.Such a list can be specified with the following image build argument:-H:JNIConfigurationFiles=/path/to/jni-config.jsonHere, jni-config.json is a JSON configuration file.Check the JSON schema for specifing JNI metadata here.The native-image builder generates JNI reflection metadata for all classes, methods, and fields referenced in the configuration file.More than one JNI configuration can be used by specifying multiple paths for JNIConfigurationFiles and separating them with ,.Also, -H:JNIConfigurationResources can be specified to load one or several configuration files from the image build’s class path, such as from a JAR file.The JNI configuration can be collected automatically using the Tracing Agent from the GraalVM JDK. The agent tracks all usages of dynamic features during application execution on a regular Java VM. When the application completes and the JVM exits, the agent writes configuration to JSON files in the specified output directory.If you move the generated configuration files from that output directory to META-INF/native-image/ on the class path, they are then automatically used at build time. The native-image builder searches for META-INF/native-image/ and its subdirectories for files named jni-config.json, reflect-config.json, and others.Alternatively, a custom Feature implementation can register program elements before and during the analysis phase of the image build using the JNIRuntimeAccess class. For example:class JNIRegistrationFeature implements Feature {  public void beforeAnalysis(BeforeAnalysisAccess access) {    try {      JNIRuntimeAccess.register(String.class);      JNIRuntimeAccess.register(String.class.getDeclaredField(&quot;value&quot;));      JNIRuntimeAccess.register(String.class.getDeclaredField(&quot;hash&quot;));      JNIRuntimeAccess.register(String.class.getDeclaredConstructor(char[].class));      JNIRuntimeAccess.register(String.class.getDeclaredMethod(&quot;charAt&quot;, int.class));      JNIRuntimeAccess.register(String.class.getDeclaredMethod(&quot;format&quot;, String.class, Object[].class));      JNIRuntimeAccess.register(String.CaseInsensitiveComparator.class);      JNIRuntimeAccess.register(String.CaseInsensitiveComparator.class.getDeclaredMethod(&quot;compare&quot;, String.class, String.class));    } catch (NoSuchMethodException | NoSuchFieldException e) { ... }  }}To activate the custom feature, pass --features=&amp;lt;fully qualified name of JNIRegistrationFeature class&amp;gt; to the native-image builder.Native Image Build Configuration explains how this can be automated with a native-image.properties file in META-INF/native-image.java.lang.reflect SupportThe JNI functions FromReflectedMethod and ToReflectedMethod can be used to obtain the corresponding jmethodID to a java.lang.reflect.Method, or to a java.lang.reflect.Constructor object, and vice versa.The functions FromReflectedField and ToReflectedField convert between jfieldID and java.lang.reflect.Field.In order to use these functions, reflection support must be enabled and the methods and fields in question must be included in the reflection configuration, which is specified with -H:ReflectionConfigurationFiles=.Object HandlesJNI does not permit direct access to Java objects.Instead, JNI provides word-sized object handles that can be passed to JNI functions to access objects indirectly.Local handles are only valid for the duration of a native call and only in the caller’s thread, while global handles are valid across threads and remain valid until they are destroyed explicitly.The handle 0 represents NULL.Native Image implements local handles with a thread-local, growing array of referenced objects, where the index in the array is the handle value.A “finger” points to where the next handle will be allocated.Native calls can be nested, so before a native method is invoked, the call stub pushes the current finger on a stack, and after it returns, it restores the old finger from the stack and nullifies all object references from the call in the array.Global handles are implemented using a variable number of object arrays in which referenced objects are inserted and nullified using atomic operations.A global handle’s value is a negative integer that is determined from the index of the containing array and the index within the array.Therefore, the JNI code can distinguish local and global handles by only looking at their sign.The analysis is not obstructed by object handles because it can observe the entire flow of object references and the handles that are passed to native code are only numeric values.Java-to-Native Method CallsMethods declared with the native keyword have a JNI-compliant implementation in native code, but can be called like any other Java method. For example:// Java declarationnative int[] sort0(int[] array);// native declaration with JNI name manglingjintArray JNICALL Java_org_example_sorter_IntSorter_sort0(JNIEnv *env, jobject this, jintArray array)When the image build encounters a method that is declared native, it generates a graph with a wrapper that performs the transition to native code and back, adds the JNIEnv* and this arguments, boxes any object arguments in handles, and in case of an object return type, unboxes the returned handle.The actual native call target address can only be determined at run time.Therefore, the native-image builder also creates an extra linkage object in the reflection metadata of native-declared methods.When a native method is called, the call wrapper looks up the matching symbol in all loaded libraries and stores the resolved address in the linkage object for future calls.Alternatively, instead of requiring symbols that conform to JNI name mangling scheme, Native Image also supports the RegisterNatives JNI function to explicitly provide code addresses for native methods.Native-to-Java Method CallsNative code can invoke Java methods by first obtaining a jmethodID for the target method, and then using one of the Call&amp;lt;Type&amp;gt;Method, CallStatic&amp;lt;Type&amp;gt;Method or CallNonvirtual&amp;lt;Type&amp;gt;Method functions for the invocation.Each of these Call... functions is also available in a Call...MethodA and a Call...MethodV variant, which take arguments as an array or as a va_list instead of variadic arguments. For example:jmethodID intcomparator_compare_method = (*env)-&amp;gt;GetMethodID(env, intcomparator_class, &quot;compare&quot;, &quot;(II)I&quot;);jint result = (*env)-&amp;gt;CallIntMethod(env, this, intcomparator_compare_method, a, b);The native-image builder generates call wrappers for each method that can be called via JNI according to the provided JNI configuration.The call wrappers conform to the signature of the JNI Call... functions that are appropriate for the method.The wrappers perform the transition to Java code and back, adapt the argument list to the target Java method’s signature, unbox any passed object handles, and if necessary, box the return type in an object handle.Each method that can be called via JNI has a reflection metadata object.The address of this object is used as the method’s jmethodID.The metadata object contains the addresses of all of the method’s generated call wrappers.Because each call wrapper conforms precisely to the corresponding Call... function signature, the Call... functions themselves are nothing more than an unconditional jump to the appropriate call wrapper based on the passed jmethodID.As another optimization, the call wrappers are able to efficiently restore the current thread’s Java context from the JNIEnv* argument.JNI FunctionsJNI provides a set of functions that native code can use to interact with Java code.Native Image implements these functions using @CEntryPoint, for example:@CEntryPoint(...) private static void DeleteGlobalRef(JNIEnvironment env, JNIObjectHandle globalRef) { /* setup; */ JNIGlobalHandles.singleton().delete(globalRef); }JNI specifies that these functions are provided via function pointers in a C struct that is accessible via the JNIEnv* argument.The automatic initialization of this struct is prepared during the image build.Object CreationJNI provides two ways of creating Java objects, either by calling AllocObject to allocate memory and then using CallVoidMethod to invoke the constructor, or by using NewObject to create and initialize the object in a single step (or variants NewObjectA or NewObjectV). For example:jclass calendarClass = (*env)-&amp;gt;FindClass(env, &quot;java/util/GregorianCalendar&quot;);jmethodID ctor = (*env)-&amp;gt;GetMethodID(env, calendarClass, &quot;&amp;lt;init&amp;gt;&quot;, &quot;(IIIIII)V&quot;);jobject firstObject = (*env)-&amp;gt;AllocObject(env, calendarClass);(*env)-&amp;gt;CallVoidMethod(env, obj, ctor, year, month, dayOfMonth, hourOfDay, minute, second);jobject secondObject = (*env)-&amp;gt;NewObject(env, calendarClass, ctor, year, month, dayOfMonth, hourOfDay, minute, second);Native Image supports both approaches.The constructor must be included in the JNI configuration with a method name of &amp;lt;init&amp;gt;.Instead of generating additional call wrappers for NewObject, the regular CallVoidMethod wrapper is reused and detects when it is called via NewObject because it is passed the Class object of the target class.In that case, the call wrapper allocates a new instance before invoking the actual constructor.Field AccessesNative code can access a Java field by obtaining its jfieldID and then using one of the Get&amp;lt;Type&amp;gt;Field, Set&amp;lt;Type&amp;gt;Field, GetStatic&amp;lt;Type&amp;gt;Field or SetStatic&amp;lt;Type&amp;gt;Field functions. For example:jfieldID intsorter_comparator_field = (*env)-&amp;gt;GetFieldID(env, intsorter_class, &quot;comparator&quot;, &quot;Lorg/example/sorter/IntComparator;&quot;);jobject value = (*env)-&amp;gt;GetObjectField(env, self, intsorter_comparator_field);For a field that is accessible via JNI, its offset within an object (or within the static field area) is stored in the reflection metadata and is used as its jfieldID.The native-image builder generates accessor methods for fields of all primitive types and for object fields.These accessor methods perform the transition to Java code and back, and use unsafe loads or stores to directly manipulate the field value.Because the analysis cannot observe assignments of object fields via JNI, it assumes that any subtype of the field’s declared type can occur in a field that is accessible via JNI.JNI also permits writing fields that are declared final, which must be enabled for individual fields with an allowWrite property in the configuration file.However, code accessing final fields might not observe changes of final field values in the same way as for non-final fields because of optimizations.ExceptionsJNI specifies that exceptions in Java code that are the result of a call from native code must be caught and retained.In Native Image, this is done in the native-to-Java call wrappers and in the implementation of JNI functions.Native code can then query and clear a pending exception with the ExceptionCheck, ExceptionOccurred, ExceptionDescribe, and ExceptionClear functions.Native code can also throw exceptions with Throw, ThrowNew, or FatalError.When an exception remains unhandled in native code or the native code itself throws an exception, the Java-to-native call wrapper rethrows that exception upon reentering Java code.MonitorsJNI declares the functions MonitorEnter and MonitorExit to acquire and release the intrinsic lock of an object.Native Image provides implementations of these functions.However, the native-image builder directly assigns intrinsic locks only to objects of classes which the analysis can observe as being used in Java synchronized statements and with wait(), notify() and notifyAll().For other objects, synchronization falls back on a slower mechanism which uses a map to store lock associations, which itself needs synchronization.For that reason, it can be beneficial to wrap synchronization in Java code.Related Documentation  Interoperability with Native Code  JNI Invocation API  Reachability Metadata: Java Native Interface  Collect Metadata with the Tracing Agent",

          "content": "JNI Invocation APINative Image can be used to implement low-level system operations in Java and make them available via JNI Invocation API to Java code executing on a standard JVM.As a result one can use the same language to write the application logic as well as the system calls.Note that this document describes the opposite of what is commonly done via JNI: usually low-level system operations are implemented in C and invoked from Java using JNI.If you are interested in how Native Image supports the common use case, see Java Native Interface (JNI) in Native Image.Create a Shared LibraryFirst of all one has to use the native-image builder to generate a shared library with some JNI-compatible entry points.Start with the Java code:package org.pkg.implnative;import org.graalvm.nativeimage.c.function.CEntryPoint;import org.graalvm.word.Pointer;public final class NativeImpl {    @CEntryPoint(name = &quot;Java_org_pkg_apinative_Native_add&quot;)    public static int add(Pointer jniEnv, Pointer clazz, @CEntryPoint.IsolateThreadContext long isolateId, int a, int b) {        return a + b;    }}After being processed by the native-image builder, the code exposes a C function Java_org_pkg_apinative_Native_add (the name follows conventions of JNI that will be handy later) and a Native Image signature typical for JNI methods.The first parameter is a reference to the JNIEnv* value.The second parameter is a reference to the jclass value for the class declaring the method.The third parameter is a portable (e.g., long) identifier of the Native Image isolatethread.The rest of the parameters are the actual parameters of the Java Native.add method described in the next section. Compile the code with the --shared option:$JAVA_HOME/bin/native-image --shared -H:Name=libnativeimpl -cp nativeimplThe libnativeimpl.so is generated. We are ready to use it from standard Java code.Bind a Java Native MethodNow we need another Java class to use the native library generated in the previous step:package org.pkg.apinative;public final class Native {    private static native int add(long isolateThreadId, int a, int b);}The package name of the class, as well as the name of the method, has to correspond (after the JNI mangling) to the name of the @CEntryPoint introduced previously.The first argument is a portable (e.g., long) identifier of the Native Image isolate thread.The rest of the arguments match the parameters of the entry point.Load the Native LibraryThe next step is to bind the JDK with the generated .so library.For example, make sure the implementation of the native Native.add method is loaded.Simple load or loadLibrary calls will do:public static void main(String[] args) {    System.loadLibrary(&quot;nativeimpl&quot;);    // ...}This is assuming your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable is specified, or the java.library.path Java property is properly set.Initialize a Native Image IsolateBefore making calls to the Native.add method, we need to create a Native Image isolate.Native Image provides a special built-in to allow that: CEntryPoint.Builtin.CREATE_ISOLATE.Define another method along your other existing @CEntryPoint methods.Let it return IsolateThread and take no parameters:public final class NativeImpl {    @CEntryPoint(name = &quot;Java_org_pkg_apinative_Native_createIsolate&quot;, builtin=CEntryPoint.Builtin.CREATE_ISOLATE)    public static native IsolateThread createIsolate();}Native Image then generates default native implementation of the method into the final .so library.The method initializes the Native Image runtime and returns a portable identification, e.g., long, to hold an instance of a Native Image isolatethread.The isolate thread can then be used for multiple invocations of the native part of your code:package org.pkg.apinative;public final class Native {    public static void main(String[] args) {        System.loadLibrary(&quot;nativeimpl&quot;);        long isolateThread = createIsolate();        System.out.println(&quot;2 + 40 = &quot; + add(isolateThread, 2, 40));        System.out.println(&quot;12 + 30 = &quot; + add(isolateThread, 12, 30));        System.out.println(&quot;20 + 22 = &quot; + add(isolateThread, 20, 22));    }    private static native int add(long isolateThread, int a, int b);    private static native long createIsolate();}The standard JVM is started. It initializes a Native Image isolate, attaches the current thread to the isolate, and the universal answer 42 is then computed three times inside of the isolate.Call JVM from Native JavaThere is a detailed tutorial on the C interface of Native Image.The following example shows how to make a callback to JVM.In the classical setup, when C needs to call into JVM, it uses a jni.h header file.The file defines essential JVM structures (like JNIEnv) as well as functions one can invoke to inspect classes, access fields, and call methods in the JVM.In order to call these functions from the NativeImpl class in the above example, you need to define appropriate Java API wrappers of the jni.h concepts:@CContext(JNIHeaderDirectives.class)@CStruct(value = &quot;JNIEnv_&quot;, addStructKeyword = true)interface JNIEnvironment extends PointerBase {    @CField(&quot;functions&quot;)    JNINativeInterface getFunctions();}@CPointerTo(JNIEnvironment.class)interface JNIEnvironmentPointer extends PointerBase {    JNIEnvironment read();    void write(JNIEnvironment value);}@CContext(JNIHeaderDirectives.class)@CStruct(value = &quot;JNINativeInterface_&quot;, addStructKeyword = true)interface JNINativeInterface extends PointerBase {    @CField    GetMethodId getGetStaticMethodID();    @CField    CallStaticVoidMethod getCallStaticVoidMethodA();}interface GetMethodId extends CFunctionPointer {    @InvokeCFunctionPointer    JMethodID find(JNIEnvironment env, JClass clazz, CCharPointer name, CCharPointer sig);}interface JObject extends PointerBase {}interface CallStaticVoidMethod extends CFunctionPointer {    @InvokeCFunctionPointer    void call(JNIEnvironment env, JClass cls, JMethodID methodid, JValue args);}interface JClass extends PointerBase {}interface JMethodID extends PointerBase {}Leaving aside the meaning of JNIHeaderDirectives for now, the rest of the interfaces are type-safe representations of the C pointers found in the jni.h file. JClass, JMethodID, and JObject are all pointers.Thanks to the above definitions, you now have Java interfaces to represent instances of these objects in your native Java code in a type-safe way.The core part of any JNI API is the set of functions one can call when talking to the JVM.There are dozens of them, but in the JNINativeInterface definition, you just define wrappers for those few that are needed in the example.Again, give them proper types, so in your native Java code you can use GetMethodId.find(...), CallStaticVoidMethod.call(...), etc.In addition, there is another important part missing in the puzzle - the jvalue union type wrapping all the possible Java primitive and object types.Here are definitions of its getters and setters:@CContext(JNIHeaderDirectives.class)@CStruct(&quot;jvalue&quot;)interface JValue extends PointerBase {    @CField boolean z();    @CField byte b();    @CField char c();    @CField short s();    @CField int i();    @CField long j();    @CField float f();    @CField double d();    @CField JObject l();    @CField void z(boolean b);    @CField void b(byte b);    @CField void c(char ch);    @CField void s(short s);    @CField void i(int i);    @CField void j(long l);    @CField void f(float f);    @CField void d(double d);    @CField void l(JObject obj);    JValue addressOf(int index);}The addressOf method is a special Native Image construct used to perform C pointer arithmetics.Given a pointer, one can treat it as the initial element of an array, then, for example, use addressOf(1) to access the subsequent element.With this you have all the API needed to make a callback - redefine the previously introduced NativeImpl.add method to accept properly typed pointers, and then use these pointers to invoke a JVM method before computing the sum of a + b:@CEntryPoint(name = &quot;Java_org_pkg_apinative_Native_add&quot;)static int add(JNIEnvironment env, JClass clazz, @CEntryPoint.IsolateThreadContext long isolateThreadId, int a, int b) {    JNINativeInterface fn = env.getFunctions();    try (        CTypeConversion.CCharPointerHolder name = CTypeConversion.toCString(&quot;hello&quot;);        CTypeConversion.CCharPointerHolder sig = CTypeConversion.toCString(&quot;(ZCBSIJFD)V&quot;);    ) {        JMethodID helloId = fn.getGetStaticMethodID().find(env, clazz, name.get(), sig.get());        JValue args = StackValue.get(8, JValue.class);        args.addressOf(0).z(false);        args.addressOf(1).c(&#39;A&#39;);        args.addressOf(2).b((byte)22);        args.addressOf(3).s((short)33);        args.addressOf(4).i(39);        args.addressOf(5).j(Long.MAX_VALUE / 2l);        args.addressOf(6).f((float) Math.PI);        args.addressOf(7).d(Math.PI);        fn.getCallStaticVoidMethodA().call(env, clazz, helloId, args);    }    return a + b;}The above example seeks a static method hello and invokes it with eight JValue parameters in an array reserved by StackValue.get on the stack.Individual parameters are accessed by use of the addressOf operator and filled with appropriate primitive values before the call happens.The method hello is defined in the class Native and prints values of all parameters to verify they are properly propagated from the NativeImpl.add caller:public class Native {    public static void hello(boolean z, char c, byte b, short s, int i, long j, float f, double d) {        System.err.println(&quot;Hi, I have just been called back!&quot;);        System.err.print(&quot;With: &quot; + z + &quot; &quot; + c + &quot; &quot; + b + &quot; &quot; + s);        System.err.println(&quot; and: &quot; + i + &quot; &quot; + j + &quot; &quot; + f + &quot; &quot; + d);    }There is just one final piece to explain: the JNIHeaderDirectives.The Native Image C interface needs to understand the layout of the C structures.It needs to know at which offset of JNINativeInterface structure it can find the pointer to the GetMethodId function.To do so, it needs jni.h and additional files during compilation. One can specify them by @CContext annotation and implementation of its Directives:final class JNIHeaderDirectives implements CContext.Directives {    @Override    public List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; getOptions() {        File[] jnis = findJNIHeaders();        return Arrays.asList(&quot;-I&quot; + jnis[0].getParent(), &quot;-I&quot; + jnis[1].getParent());    }    @Override    public List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; getHeaderFiles() {        File[] jnis = findJNIHeaders();        return Arrays.asList(&quot;&amp;lt;&quot; + jnis[0] + &quot;&amp;gt;&quot;, &quot;&amp;lt;&quot; + jnis[1] + &quot;&amp;gt;&quot;);    }    private static File[] findJNIHeaders() throws IllegalStateException {        final File jreHome = new File(System.getProperty(&quot;java.home&quot;));        final File include = new File(jreHome.getParentFile(), &quot;include&quot;);        final File[] jnis = {            new File(include, &quot;jni.h&quot;),            new File(new File(include, &quot;linux&quot;), &quot;jni_md.h&quot;),        };        return jnis;    }}The good thing is that jni.h is inside of every JDK, so one can use the java.home property to locate the necessary header files.The actual logic can, of course, be made more robust and OS-independent.Implementing any JVM native method in Java and/or making callbacks to the JVM with Native Image should now be as easy as expanding upon the given example and invoking native-image.Related Documentation  Interoperability with Native Code  Java Native Interface (JNI) in Native Image",

All artifacts relevant to embedders can be found in the Maven dependency group org.graalvm.polyglot.Here is an example Maven dependency setup that you can put into your Java project:&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt; &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.polyglot&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;polyglot&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;${graalvm.version}&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt; &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.polyglot&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;js&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;${graalvm.version}&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt; &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;pom&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;The JavaScript (GraalJS) and Node.js runtimes are also available as standalone distributions.There are two runtime options to choose from: a Native Image compiled native launcher or a JVM-based runtime (included).To enable interoperability with Java, use a JVM-based standalone: it has a -jvm suffix in a name, for example: graaljs-jvm-&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;os&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;arch&amp;gt;.tar.gz. See Getting Started.The following examples assume the last setup is used.ClasspathTo load Java classes you need to have them on the Java classpath.You can specify the classpath with the --vm.classpath=&amp;lt;classpath&amp;gt; option (or short: --vm.cp=&amp;lt;classpath&amp;gt;):node --vm.cp=/my/class/pathjs --vm.cp=/my/class/pathThe method Java.addToClasspath() can be used to programmatically add to the classpath at runtime.Polyglot ContextThe preferred method of launching GraalVM JavaScript with Java interop support is via polyglot Context.For that, a new org.graalvm.polyglot.Context is built with the hostAccess option allowing access and a hostClassLookup predicate defining the Java classes you allow access to:Context context = Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;)    .allowHostAccess(HostAccess.ALL)    //allows access to all Java classes    .allowHostClassLookup(className -&amp;gt; true)    .build();context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, jsSourceCode);See the Embedding Reference on how to interact with a guest language like JavaScript from a Java host application.The Polyglot Programming guide can also be of help in that area.ScriptEngine (JSR 223)The org.graalvm.polyglot.Context is the preferred execution method for interoperability with GraalVM’s languages and tools.In addition, JavaScript running on GraalVM is fully compatible with JSR 223 and supports the ScriptEngine API.Internally, the GraalVM’s JavaScript ScriptEngine wraps a polyglot context instance:ScriptEngine eng = new ScriptEngineManager()    .getEngineByName(&quot;graal.js&quot;);Object fn = eng.eval(&quot;(function() { return this; })&quot;);Invocable inv = (Invocable) eng;Object result = inv.invokeMethod(fn, &quot;call&quot;, fn);See the ScriptEngine guide for more details on how to use it from GraalVM JavaScript.Access Java from JavaScriptGraalVM provides a set of features to allow interoperability from JavaScript to Java.While Rhino, Nashorn, and GraalVM JavaScript have a mostly comparable overall feature set, they differ in exact syntax, and, partly, semantics.Class AccessTo access a Java class, GraalVM JavaScript supports the Java.type(typeName) function:var FileClass = Java.type(&#39;java.io.File&#39;);By default, Java classes are not automatically mapped to global variables, e.g., there is no java global property in GraalVM JavaScript.Existing code accessing, e.g., java.io.File, should be rewritten to use the Java.type(name) function://GraalVM JavaScript compliant syntaxvar FileClass = Java.type(&quot;java.io.File&quot;);//backwards-compatible syntaxvar FileClass = java.io.File;GraalVM JavaScript provides Packages, java, and similar global properties for compatibility.However, explicitly accessing the required class with Java.type is preferred whenever possible for two reasons:  It allows resolving the class in one step rather than trying to resolve each property as a class.  Java.type immediately throws a TypeError if the class cannot be found or is not accessible, rather than silently treating an unresolved name as a package.The js.java-package-globals flag can be used to deactivate the global fields of Java packages (set false to avoid creation of the fields; default is true).Constructing Java ObjectsJava objects can be constructed with JavaScript’s new keyword:var FileClass = Java.type(&#39;java.io.File&#39;);var file = new FileClass(&quot;myFile.md&quot;);Field and Method AccessStatic fields of a Java class, or fields of a Java object, can be accessed like JavaScript properties:var JavaPI = Java.type(&#39;java.lang.Math&#39;).PI;Java methods can be called like JavaScript functions:var file = new (Java.type(&#39;java.io.File&#39;))(&quot;test.md&quot;);var fileName = file.getName();Conversion of Method ArgumentsJavaScript is defined to operate on the double number type.GraalVM JavaScript might internally use additional Java data types for performance reasons (e.g., the int type).When calling Java methods, a value conversion might be required.This happens when the Java method expects a long parameter, and an int is provided from GraalVM JavaScript (type widening).If this conversion causes a lossy conversion, a TypeError is thrown://Javavoid longArg   (long arg1);void doubleArg (double arg2);void intArg    (int arg3);//JavaScriptjavaObject.longArg(1);     //widening, OKjavaObject.doubleArg(1);   //widening, OKjavaObject.intArg(1);      //match, OKjavaObject.longArg(1.1);   //lossy conversion, TypeError!javaObject.doubleArg(1.1); //match, OKjavaObject.intArg(1.1);    //lossy conversion, TypeError!Note how the argument values have to fit into the parameter types.You can override this behavior using custom target type mappings.Selection of MethodJava allows overloading of methods by argument types.When calling from JavaScript to Java, the method with the narrowest available type that the actual argument can be converted to without loss is selected://Javavoid foo(int arg);void foo(short arg);void foo(double arg);void foo(long arg);//JavaScriptjavaObject.foo(1);              // will call foo(short);javaObject.foo(Math.pow(2,16)); // will call foo(int);javaObject.foo(1.1);            // will call foo(double);javaObject.foo(Math.pow(2,32)); // will call foo(long);To override this behavior, an explicit method overload can be selected using the javaObject[&#39;methodName(paramTypes)&#39;] syntax.Parameter types need to be comma-separated without spaces, and Object types need to be fully qualified (e.g., &#39;get(java.lang.String,java.lang.String[])&#39;).Note that this is different from Nashorn which allows extra spaces and simple names.In the example above, one might always want to call, e.g., foo(long), even when foo(short) can be reached with lossless conversion (foo(1)):javaObject[&#39;foo(int)&#39;](1);javaObject[&#39;foo(long)&#39;](1);javaObject[&#39;foo(double)&#39;](1);Note that the argument values still have to fit into the parameter types.You can override this behavior using custom target type mappings.An explicit method selection can also be useful when the method overloads are ambiguous and cannot be automatically resolved as well as when you want to override the default choice://Javavoid sort(List&amp;lt;Object&amp;gt; array, Comparator&amp;lt;Object&amp;gt; callback);void sort(List&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; array, IntBinaryOperator callback);void consumeArray(List&amp;lt;Object&amp;gt; array);void consumeArray(Object[] array);//JavaScriptvar array = [3, 13, 3, 7];var compare = (x, y) =&amp;gt; (x &amp;lt; y) ? -1 : ((x == y) ? 0 : 1);// throws TypeError: Multiple applicable overloads foundjavaObject.sort(array, compare);// explicitly select sort(List, Comparator)javaObject[&#39;sort(java.util.List,java.util.Comparator)&#39;](array, compare);// will call consumeArray(List)javaObject.consumeArray(array);// explicitly select consumeArray(Object[])javaObject[&#39;consumeArray(java.lang.Object[])&#39;](array);Note that there is currently no way to explicitly select constructor overloads.Future versions of GraalVM JavaScript might lift that restriction.Package AccessGraalVM JavaScript provides a Packages global property:&amp;gt; Packages.java.io.FileJavaClass[java.io.File]Array AccessGraalVM JavaScript supports the creation of Java arrays from JavaScript code.Both the patterns suggested by Rhino and Nashorn are supported://Rhino patternvar JArray = Java.type(&#39;java.lang.reflect.Array&#39;);var JString = Java.type(&#39;java.lang.String&#39;);var sarr = JArray.newInstance(JString, 5);//Nashorn patternvar IntArray = Java.type(&quot;int[]&quot;);var iarr = new IntArray(5);The arrays created are Java types, but can be used in JavaScript code:iarr[0] = iarr[iarr.length] * 2;Map AccessIn GraalVM JavaScript you can create and access Java Maps, e.g., java.util.HashMap:var HashMap = Java.type(&#39;java.util.HashMap&#39;);var map = new HashMap();map.put(1, &quot;a&quot;);map.get(1);GraalVM JavaScript supports iterating over such maps similar to Nashorn:for (var key in map) {    print(key);    print(map.get(key));}List AccessIn GraalVM JavaScript you can create and access Java Lists, e.g., java.util.ArrayList:var ArrayList = Java.type(&#39;java.util.ArrayList&#39;);var list = new ArrayList();list.add(42);list.add(&quot;23&quot;);list.add({});for (var idx in list) {    print(idx);    print(list.get(idx));}String AccessGraalVM JavaScript can create Java strings with Java interoperability.The length of the string can be queried with the length property (note that length is a value property and cannot be called as a function):var javaString = new (Java.type(&#39;java.lang.String&#39;))(&quot;Java&quot;);javaString.length === 4;Note that GraalVM JavaScript uses Java strings internally to represent JavaScript strings, so the above code and the JavaScript string literal &quot;Java&quot; are actually not distinguishable.Iterating PropertiesProperties (fields and methods) of Java classes and Java objects can be iterated with a JavaScript for..in loop:var m = Java.type(&#39;java.lang.Math&#39;)for (var i in m) { print(i); }&amp;gt; E&amp;gt; PI&amp;gt; abs&amp;gt; sin&amp;gt; ...Access to JavaScript Objects from JavaJavaScript objects are exposed to Java code as instances of com.oracle.truffle.api.interop.java.TruffleMap.This class implements Java’s Map interface.JavaImporterThe JavaImporter feature is available only in Nashorn compatibility mode (js.nashorn-compat option).Console Output of Java Classes and Java ObjectsGraalVM JavaScript provides both print and console.log.GraalVM JavaScript provides a print built-in function compatible with Nashorn.The console.log is provided by Node.js directly.It does not provide special treatment of interop objects.Note that the default implementation of console.log on GraalVM JavaScript is just an alias for print, and Node’s implementation is only available when running on Node.js.ExceptionsExceptions thrown in Java code can be caught in JavaScript code.They are represented as Java objects:try {    Java.type(&#39;java.lang.Class&#39;)    .forName(&quot;nonexistent&quot;);} catch (e) {    print(e.getMessage());}PromisesGraalVM JavaScript provides support for interoperability between JavaScript Promise objects and Java.Java objects can be exposed to JavaScript code as thenable objects, allowing JavaScript code to await Java objects.Moreover, JavaScript Promise objects are regular JavaScript objects, and can be accessed from Java using the mechanisms described in this document.This allows Java code to be called back from JavaScript when a JavaScript promise is resolved or rejected.Creating JavaScript Promise Objects That Can Be Resolved from JavaJavaScript applications can create Promise objects delegating to Java the resolution of the Promise instance.This can be achieved from JavaScript by using a Java object as the “executor” function of the JavaScript Promise.For example, Java objects implementing the following functional interface can be used to create new Promise objects:@FunctionalInterfacepublic interface PromiseExecutor {    void onPromiseCreation(Value onResolve, Value onReject);}Any Java object implementing PromiseExecutor can be used to create a JavaScript Promise:// `javaExecutable` is a Java object implementing the `PromiseExecutor` interfacevar myPromise = new Promise(javaExecutable).then(...);JavaScript Promise objects can be created not only using functional interfaces, but also using any other Java object that can be executed by the GraalVM JavaScript engine (for example, any Java object implementing the Polyglot ProxyExecutable interface).More detailed example usages are available in the GraalVM JavaScript unit tests.Using await with Java ObjectsJavaScript applications can use the await expression with Java objects.This can be useful when Java and JavaScript have to interact with asynchronous events.To expose a Java object to GraalVM JavaScript as a thenable object, the Java object should implement a method called then() having the following signature:void then(Value onResolve, Value onReject);When await is used with a Java object implementing then(), the GraalVM JavaScript runtime will treat the object as a JavaScript Promise.The onResolve and onReject arguments are executable Value objects that should be used by the Java code to resume or abort the JavaScript await expression associated with the corresponding Java object.More detailed example usages are available in the GraalVM JavaScript unit tests.Using JavaScript Promises from JavaPromise objects created in JavaScript can be exposed to Java code like any other JavaScript object.Java code can access such objects like normal Value objects, with the possibility to register new promise resolution functions using the Promise’s default then() and catch() functions.As an example, the following Java code registers a Java callback to be executed when a JavaScript promise resolves:Value jsPromise = context.eval(ID, &quot;Promise.resolve(42);&quot;);Consumer&amp;lt;Object&amp;gt; javaThen = (value)    -&amp;gt; System.out.println(&quot;Resolved from JavaScript: &quot; + value);jsPromise.invokeMember(&quot;then&quot;, javaThen);More detailed example usages are available in the GraalVM JavaScript unit tests.MultithreadingGraalVM JavaScript supports multithreading when used in combination with Java. More details about the GraalVM JavaScript multithreading model can be found in the Multithreading documentation.Extending Java classesGraalVM JavaScript provides support for extending Java classes and interfaces using the Java.extend function.Note that host access has to be enabled in the polyglot context for this feature to be available.Java.extendJava.extend(types...) returns a generated adapter Java class object that extends the specified Java class and/or interfaces.For example:var Ext = Java.extend(Java.type(&quot;some.AbstractClass&quot;),                      Java.type(&quot;some.Interface1&quot;),                      Java.type(&quot;some.Interface2&quot;));var impl = new Ext({  superclassMethod: function() {/*...*/},  interface1Method: function() {/*...*/},  interface2Method: function() {/*...*/},  toString() {return &quot;MyClass&quot;;}});impl.superclassMethod();Super methods can be called via Java.super(adapterInstance).See a combined example:var sw = new (Java.type(&quot;java.io.StringWriter&quot;));var FilterWriterAdapter = Java.extend(Java.type(&quot;java.io.FilterWriter&quot;));var fw = new FilterWriterAdapter(sw, {    write: function(s, off, len) {        s = s.toUpperCase();        if (off === undefined) {            fw_super.write(s, 0, s.length)        } else {            fw_super.write(s, off, len)        }    }});var fw_super = Java.super(fw);fw.write(&quot;abcdefg&quot;);fw.write(&quot;h&quot;.charAt(0));fw.write(&quot;**ijk**&quot;, 2, 3);fw.write(&quot;***lmno**&quot;, 3, 4);print(sw); // ABCDEFGHIJKLMNONote that in the nashorn-compat mode, you can also extend interfaces and abstract classes using a new operator on a type object of an interface or an abstract class:// --experimental-options --js.nashorn-compatvar JFunction = Java.type(&#39;java.util.function.Function&#39;); var sqFn = new JFunction({   apply: function(x) { return x * x; }});sqFn.apply(6); // 36",

The standard new function interprets String arguments as a Java class if such class exists.  new also accepts Java types returned from java.type.  The fields and methods of Java objects can be accessed using the $ operator.  Additionally, you can use awt(...) to open an R drawing devicedirectly on a Java Graphics surface. For more details see Java Graphics Interoperability.The following example creates a new Java BufferedImage object, plots random data to it using R’s grid package,and shows an image in a window using Java’s AWT framework.Note that you must start the R script with --jvm to have access to Java interoperability.library(grid)openJavaWindow &amp;lt;- function () {   # create image and register graphics   imageClass &amp;lt;- java.type(&#39;java.awt.image.BufferedImage&#39;)   image &amp;lt;- new(imageClass, 450, 450, imageClass$TYPE_INT_RGB);

java.addToClasspath(&quot;/foo/bar.jar&quot;)&amp;gt; java.addToClasspath(c(&quot;/foo/bar.jar&quot;, &quot;/foo/bar2.jar&quot;))Getting a Java ClassThe access to a Java type is achieved by providing a fully qualified class name to the java.type function:&amp;gt; calendarClass &amp;lt;- java.type(&#39;java.util.GregorianCalendar&#39;)The returned value is a polyglot object representing a Java type.The respective Java class is then available through the class property:&amp;gt; calendarClass$classThe same works also for static class members:&amp;gt; calendarClass$getInstance()Every requested class has to be on the R classpath.The JDK classes, like GregorianCalendar used above, work out of the box.Creating a New Java ObjectA new Java object can be created by providing a Java type to the new function:&amp;gt; calendar &amp;lt;- new(calendarClass)It is also possible to pass over additional constructor arguments:&amp;gt; calendar &amp;lt;- new(calendarClass, year=2042L, moth=3L, day=1L)Alternately, you can use just a class name:calendar &amp;lt;- new(&quot;java.util.GregorianCalendar&quot;)calendar &amp;lt;- new(&quot;java.util.GregorianCalendar&quot;, year=2042L, moth=3L, day=1L)Accessing Fields and MethodsThe access to static and instance fields and methods is provided by the $ and [ operators.To access Java fields:&amp;gt; calendarClass$SUNDAY&amp;gt; calendarClass[&quot;SUNDAY&quot;]To invoke Java methods:&amp;gt; currentTime &amp;lt;- calendar$getTime()&amp;gt; currentTime[&quot;toString&quot;]()&amp;gt; calendar$setTime(currentTime)Polyglot objects returned from a field or method, or created via new, are either automatically converted into corresponding R values or they live on as polyglot objects in the GraalVM R runtime.If necessary, they can be passed over to Java:&amp;gt; cet &amp;lt;- java.type(&quot;java.util.TimeZone&quot;)$getTimeZone(&quot;CET&quot;)&amp;gt; cetCalendar &amp;lt;- new(calendarClass, cet)Handling of Java PrimitivesThe returned Java primitives, primitive wrappers, and String instances are automatically converted into corresponding R values and map as follows:  R integer values map directly to Java int/Integer  R numeric to Java double/Double  R logical to Java boolean/Boolean  R character to Java String  If necessary R integer and double are converted to the expected Java typeInspecting Polyglot ObjectsThe names function can be used to obtain a list of instance and static members from a polyglot Java object or Java class:&amp;gt; names(calendar)&amp;gt; names(calendarClass)Code completion works as well:&amp;gt; calendar$a&amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;Working with Java ArraysThe need for Java arrays appears when they have to be passed over to java as arguments.You can create an array by creating an array class and instantiating an array from it:&amp;gt; arrayClass &amp;lt;- java.type(&#39;int[]&#39;)&amp;gt; intArray &amp;lt;- new(arrayClass, 3)The component type names of primitive arrays are boolean, byte, char, double, float, int, long,and short – the same as in each particular primitive wrapper TYPE constant (see, e.g., Integer.TYPE.getName()).Note that it is possible to pass an R vector into a Java method in case the expected Java array is of a primitive component type or String.Then, the conversion happens automatically in the background.&amp;gt; integerArray &amp;lt;- new(java.type(&#39;java.lang.Integer[]&#39;), 3L)&amp;gt; integer2DimArray &amp;lt;- new(&#39;java.lang.Integer[][]&#39;, c(2L, 3L))&amp;gt; stringArray &amp;lt;- new(java.type(&#39;java.lang.String[]&#39;), 3L)The access to array elements is provided by the [ operator:&amp;gt; stringArray[1] &amp;lt;- &#39;a&#39;&amp;gt; string2DimArray[1,1] &amp;lt;- &#39;a&#39;&amp;gt; element &amp;lt;- stringArray[1]&amp;gt; element &amp;lt;- string2DimArray[1,1]Converting Java Arrays into R ObjectsUnlike Java primitives or their wrappers, Java arrays are not automatically converted into an R vector.Nevertheless, when appropriate, they can be handled by R builtin functions the same way as native R objects:&amp;gt; sapply(intArray, function(e) { e })&amp;gt; length(stringArray)&amp;gt; length(string2DimArray[1])Explicit Java Array ConversionA Java array conversion can be done explicitly by providing a Java array to the as.vector function:&amp;gt; intVec &amp;lt;- as.vector(intArray)Arrays having a Java primitive component type are converted into an R vector.Otherwise a list containing the array elements is created:&amp;gt; characterVector &amp;lt;- as.character(intArray)&amp;gt; logicalVector &amp;lt;- as.logical(intArray)&amp;gt; ...Java Iterable InterfaceWhen appropriate, Java objects implementing java.lang.Iterable are handled in the same way as Java arrays when passed as arguments to functions:&amp;gt; javaList &amp;lt;- new(java.type(&#39;java.util.ArrayList&#39;))&amp;gt; javaList$add(0);&amp;gt; javaList$add(1)&amp;gt; length(javaList)&amp;gt; as.integer(javaList)&amp;gt; as.logical(javaList)Compatibility with rJavaThe GraalVM R runtime comes with an rJava compatibility layer based on the Java interoperability features.Most of the officially documented rJava functions are supported.For more information, see the rJava CRAN documentation.  You can install the GraalVM R runtime’s rJava replacement using install.packages(&quot;rJava&quot;).The install.packages function in R has special handling for some packages, including rJava, and it downloads rJava from the source repository on GitHub instead of from MRAN.  As with any other R package, before executing any rJava functions, the package has to be loaded first:    &amp;gt; library(rJava)  Supported rJava features:  The $ and [ operators work the same as described above.Java Graphics InteroperabilityGraalVM R runtime’s graphics subsystem is mostly compatible with GNU-R’s graphics subsystem, i.e., most of the functions provided by grid and graphics base packages are supported.See Reference of GNU-R’s graphical subsystem.Aside from all the GNU-R graphics functionality, GraalVM R runtime provides an additional awt device and functions tailored to manipulate the SVG device: svg.off and sv.string.The awt device is based on the Java Graphics2D object and users can pass it to their own Graphics2D object instance when opening the device using the awt function, as shown in the Java interop example.When the Graphics2D object is not provided to awt, it opens a new window similar to X11.The SVG device is demonstrated in the following code sample:library(lattice)svg()mtcars$cars &amp;lt;- rownames(mtcars)print(barchart(cars~mpg, data=mtcars))svgCode &amp;lt;- svg.off()cat(svgCode)To learn more, see the ?functionName syntax.",

          "content": "JavaScript CompatibilityGraalVM provides an ECMAScript-compliant JavaScript language runtime.This document explains the public API it presents for user applications written in JavaScript.  ECMAScript Language Compliance  Compatibility Extensions  GraalVM JavaScript ExtensionsECMAScript Language ComplianceGraalVM JavaScript implements JavaScript as prescribed in the ECMAScript (ECMA-262) specification.It is fully compatible with the ECMAScript 2023 specification (sometimes referred to as the 14th edition).New features are frequently added to GraalVM when they are confirmed to be part of ECMAScript 2024, see the CHANGELOG.md for details.Older versions starting from ECMAScript 5 can be enabled with a config flag (by number: --js.ecmascript-version=5 or by year: --js.ecmascript-version=2019).In a production setup you might consider specifying a fixed ECMAScript version to be used, as future versions of GraalVM JavaScript will use newer versions of the specification once available.GraalVM JavaScript provides the following function objects in the global scope as specified by ECMAScript, representing the JavaScript core library:Array, ArrayBuffer, Boolean, DataView, Date, Error, Function, JSON, Map, Math, Number, Object, Promise, Proxy, Reflect, RegExp, Set, SharedArrayBuffer, String, Symbol, TypedArray, WeakMap, and WeakSet.Additional objects are available under flags, for instance Temporal (flag: --js.temporal).Run js --help or js --help:languages for the list of available flags.Several of these function objects and some of their members are only available when a certain version of the specification is selected for execution.For a list of methods provided, inspect the ECMAScript specification.Extensions to the specification are specified below.Internationalization API (ECMA-402)GraalVM JavaScript comes with an implementation of the ECMA-402 Internationalization API, enabled by default (can be disabled using the following flag: --js.intl-402=false).This includes the following extensions:  Intl.Collator  Intl.DateTimeFormat  Intl.DisplayNames  Intl.ListFormat  Intl.Locale  Intl.NumberFormat  Intl.PluralRules  Intl.RelativeTimeFormat  Intl.SegmenterThe functionality of a few other built-ins, like toLocaleString, is also updated according to the ECMA-402 specification.JavaScript ModulesGraalVM JavaScript supports modules as defined by ECMAScript 6 and later.Be aware that the support for this feature grew and still grows over time. Be sure to use the latest ECMAScript version for the all the latest features.When loading modules via a polyglot Source, you can use the inofficial application/javascript+module mime type to specify you are loading a module.When loading with JavaScript code from a file, make sure the module is loaded from a file with the .mjs extension.Loading with the import keyword is not limited by that, and can import from a file of any extension.Compatibility ExtensionsThe following objects and methods are available in GraalVM JavaScript for compatibility with other JavaScript engines.Note that the behavior of such methods might not strictly match the semantics of those methods in all existing engines.Language FeaturesConditional Catch ClausesGraalVM JavaScript supports conditional catch clauses if the js.syntax-extensions option is enabled:try {    myMethod(); // can throw} catch (e if e instanceof TypeError) {    print(&quot;TypeError caught&quot;);} catch (e) {    print(&quot;another Error caught&quot;);}Global Propertiesload(source)  loads (parses and executes) the specified JavaScript source codeSource can be of type:  a String: the path of the source file or a URL to execute.  java.lang.URL: the URL is queried for the source code to execute if the js.load-from-url option is set to true.  java.io.File: the file is read for the source code to execute.  a JavaScript object: the object is queried for a name and a script property, which represent the source name and code, respectively.  all other types: the source is converted to a String.load is available by default and can be deactivated by setting the js.load option to false.print(...arg) and printErr(...arg)  prints the arguments on the console (stdout and stderr, respectively)  provides a best-effort human readable outputprint and printErr are available by default and can be deactivated by setting the js.print option to false.Methods of the console Global ObjectA global console object is provided that offers several methods for debugging purposes.These methods strive to provide similar functionality as provided in other engines, but do not guarantee identical results.Note that those methods behave differently when GraalVM JavaScript is executed in Node.js mode (i.e., the node executable is started instead of js).Node.js provides its own implementation that is used instead.  console.log, console.info, and console.debug: an alias for print(...arg)  console.error, and console.warn: similar to print, but using the error IO stream  console.assert(check, message): prints message when check is falsy  console.clear: clears the console window if possible  console.count(), and console.countReset(): counts and print how many times it has been called, or resets this counter  console.group, and console.groupEnd: increases or decreases the indentation for succeeding outputs to the console  console.time(), console.timeLog(), and console.timeEnd(): starts a timer, prints the duration the timer has been active, or prints the duration and stops the timer, respectivelyThe console object is available by default and can be deactivated by setting the option js.console to false.Additional Global Functions in the js Shellquit(status)  exits the engine and returns the specified status coderead(file)  reads the content of fileThe result is returned as a String.The argument file can be of type:  java.io.File: the file is used directly.  all other types: file is converted to a String and interpreted as a file name.readbuffer(file)  reads the content of file similar to the read functionThe result is returned as a JavaScript ArrayBuffer object.readline()  reads one line of input from the input streamThe result is returned as a String.ObjectObject.prototype.__defineGetter__(prop, func)  defines the prop property of this to be the getter function funcThis functionality is deprecated in most JavaScript engines.In recent ECMAScript versions, getters and setters are natively supported by the language.Object.prototype.__defineSetter__(prop, func)  defines the prop property of this to be the setter function funcThis functionality is deprecated in most JavaScript engines.In recent ECMAScript versions, getters and setters are natively supported by the language.Object.prototype.__lookupGetter__(prop)  returns the getter function for property prop of the object as set by __defineGetter__This functionality is deprecated in most JavaScript engines.In recent ECMAScript versions, getters and setters are natively supported by the language.Object.prototype.__lookupSetter__(prop)  returns the setter function for property prop of the object as set by __defineSetter__This functionality is deprecated in most JavaScript engines.In recent ECMAScript versions, getters and setters are natively supported by the language.Nashorn Scripting ModeGraalVM JavaScript provides a scripting mode compatible with the one provided by the Nashorn engine.It is enabled with the js.scripting option. Make sure to have --experimental-options set:js --experimental-options --js.scripting=trueIn scripting mode, several properties and functions are added to the global object, including readFully, readLine, $ARG, $ENV, and $EXEC.There are migration guides available for code previously targeted to the Nashorn or Rhino engines.GraalVM JavaScript ExtensionsGraal ObjectThe Graal object is provided as a property of the global object.It provides Graal-specific information.The existence of the property can be used to identify whether the GraalVM JavaScript engine is the current language engine:if (typeof Graal != &#39;undefined&#39;) {    print(Graal.versionECMAScript);    print(Graal.versionGraalVM);    print(Graal.isGraalRuntime());}The Graal object is available in GraalVM JavaScript by default, unless deactivated by an option (js.graal-builtin=false).Graal.versionECMAScript  provides the version number (year value) of GraalVM JavaScript’s ECMAScript compatibility mode.Graal.versionGraalVM  provides the version of GraalVM, if the current engine is executed on GraalVMGraal.isGraalRuntime()  provides whether GraalVM JavaScript is executed on a GraalVM-enabled runtime  If true, hot code is compiled by the GraalVM compiler, resulting in high peak performance.  If false, GraalVM JavaScript will not be optimized by the GraalVM Compiler, typically resulting in lower performance.Graal.setUnhandledPromiseRejectionHandler(handler)  provides the unhandled promise rejection handler when using option (js.unhandled-rejections=handler).  the handler is called with two arguments: (rejectionReason, unhandledPromise).  Graal.setUnhandledPromiseRejectionHandler can be called with null, undefined, or empty arguments to clear the handler.JavaThe Java object is only available when host class lookup is allowed.In order to access Java host classes and its members, they first need to be allowed by the host access policy, and when running from a Native Image, be registered for run time reflection.Note that some functions require the Nashorn compatibility mode flag to be set.When running from the JVM standalone distribution, this flag can be set with:js --experimental-options --js.nashorn-compat=trueJava.type(className)Java.type loads the specified Java class and returns a constructible object that has the static members (i.e. methods and fields) of the class and can be used with the new keyword to construct new instances:var BigDecimal = Java.type(&#39;java.math.BigDecimal&#39;);var point1 = new BigDecimal(&quot;0.1&quot;);var two = BigDecimal.TWO;console.log(point1.multiply(two).toString());Note that when used directly with the new operator, Java.type(...) needs to be enclosed in parentheses:console.log(new (Java.type(&#39;java.math.BigDecimal&#39;))(&quot;1.1&quot;).pow(15));Java.from(javaData)Java.from creates a shallow copy of the Java data structure (Array, List) as a JavaScript array.In many cases, this is not necessary; you can typically use the Java data structure directly from JavaScript.Java.to(jsData, javaType)Java.to converts the argument to the Java type.The source object jsData is expected to be a JavaScript array, or an array-like object with a length property.The target javaType can either be a String (e.g. &quot;int[]&quot;) or a type object (e.g., Java.type(&quot;int[]&quot;)).Valid target types are Java arrays.When the target type is omitted, it defaults to Object[].var jsArray = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;];var stringArrayType = Java.type(&quot;java.lang.String[]&quot;);var javaArray = Java.to(jsArray, stringArrayType);assertEquals(&#39;class java.lang.String[]&#39;, String(javaArray.getClass()));var javaArray = Java.to(jsArray);assertEquals(&#39;class java.lang.Object[]&#39;, String(javaArray.getClass()));The conversion methods as defined by ECMAScript (e.g., ToString and ToDouble) are executed when a JavaScript value has to be converted to a Java type.Lossy conversion is disallowed and results in a TypeError.Java.isJavaObject(obj)  returns true if obj is a Java host object  returns false for native JavaScript objects, as well as for objects of other polyglot languagesJava.isType(obj)  returns true if obj is an object representing the constructor and static members of a Java class, as obtained by Java.type() or package objects.  returns false for all other argumentsJava.typeName(obj)  returns the Java Class name of obj when obj represents a Java type (isType(obj) === true) or Java Class instance  returns undefined otherwiseJava.isJavaFunction(fn)  returns whether fn is an object of the Java language that represents a Java function  returns false for all other types, including native JavaScript function, and functions of other polyglot languages  This function is only available in Nashorn compatibility mode (--js.nashorn-compat=true).Java.isScriptObject(obj)  returns whether obj is an object of the JavaScript language  returns false for all other types, including objects of Java and other polyglot languages  This function is only available in Nashorn compatibility mode (--js.nashorn-compat=true).Java.isScriptFunction(fn)  returns whether fn is a JavaScript function  returns false for all other types, including Java function, and functions of other polyglot languages  This function is only available in Nashorn compatibility mode (--js.nashorn-compat=true).Java.addToClasspath(location)  adds the specified location (a .jar file or directory path string) to Java’s classpathPolyglotThe functions of the Polyglot object allow to interact with values from other polyglot languages.The Polyglot object is available by default, unless deactivated by setting the js.polyglot-builtin option to false.Polyglot.export(key, value)  exports the JavaScript value under the name key (a string) to the polyglot bindings:    function helloWorld() { print(&quot;Hello, JavaScript world&quot;); }Polyglot.export(&quot;helloJSWorld&quot;, helloWorld);  If the polyglot bindings already had a value identified by key, it is overwritten with the new value. The value may be any valid Polyglot value.  throws a TypeError if key is not a String or is missingPolyglot.import(key)  imports the value identified by key (a string) from the polyglot bindings and returns it:    var rubyHelloWorld = Polyglot.import(&quot;helloRubyWorld&quot;);rubyHelloWorld();  If no language has exported a value identified by key, undefined is returned.  throws a TypeError if key is not a string or missingPolyglot.eval(languageId, sourceCode)  parses and evaluates the sourceCode with the interpreter identified by languageIdThe value of sourceCode is expected to be a String (or convertable to one).  returns the evaluation result, depending on the sourceCode and/or the semantics of the language evaluated:    var rArray = Polyglot.eval(&#39;R&#39;, &#39;runif(1000)&#39;);  Exceptions can occur when an invalid languageId is passed, when the sourceCode cannot be evaluated by the language, or when the executed program throws one.Polyglot.evalFile(languageId, sourceFileName)  parses the file sourceFileName with the interpreter identified by languageIdThe value of sourceFileName is expected to be a String (or convertable to one), representing a file reachable by the current path.  returns an executable object, typically a function:    var rFunc = Polyglot.evalFile(&#39;R&#39;, &#39;myExample.r&#39;);var result = rFunc();  Exceptions can occur when an invalid languageId is passed, when the file identified by sourceFileName cannot be found, or when the language throws an exception during parsing (parse time errors, e.g. syntax errors).Exceptions thrown by the evaluated program are only thrown once the resulting function is evaluated.The Polyglot.evalFile function is available by default when the Polyglot builtin is available, unless deactivated by setting the js.polyglot-evalfile option to false.It is also available when js.debug-builtin is activated.Debug  requires starting the engine with the js.debug-builtin flagDebug is a GraalVM JavaScript specific function object that provides functionality for debugging JavaScript code and the GraalVM JavaScript compiler.This API might change without notice. Do not use for production purposes.Global FunctionsprintErr(...arg)  behaves identical to printThe only difference is that the error stream is used to print to, instead of the default output stream.loadWithNewGlobal(source, arguments)  behaves similarly to load functionThe relevant difference is that the code is evaluated in a new global scope (Realm, as defined by ECMAScript).Source can be of type:  java.lang.URL: the URL is queried for the source code to execute.  a JavaScript object: the object is queried for a name and a script property.  all other types: the source is converted to a String.The value of arguments is provided to the loaded code upon execution.",

          "title": "Jipher JCE with Native Image",
          "content": "Jipher JCE with Native ImageJipher JCE is an Oracle-developed Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) provider that packages a pre-configured and FIPS validated version of OpenSSL 3.0. The Jipher provider supports algorithms which are allowed by FIPS, including the OpenSSL 3.0’s FIPS provider. Jipher provides competitive performance compared to Bouncy Castle or the default JDK providers.It is recommended to enable Jipher with Native Image in contexts where only FIPS-allowed algorithms should be used. Note that some algorithms are allowed by FIPS for specific use cases only. As a result, some algorithms provided by Jipher might not be allowed by FIPS for all purposes.  Note: Jipher is not available in GraalVM Community Edition. It is supported on Linux and macOS (macOS 10.15 and higher) on both AMD64 and AArch64 architectures.Jipher JARs are included in the Oracle GraalVM core package at: lib/jipher/jipher-jce.jar and lib/jipher/jipher-pki.jar.To enable Jipher, pass these JARs on the application class path.This page describes how to use Jipher with GraalVM Native Image.Build a Native Executable with JipherJCA algorithms rely on reflection. To include all required code paths in the native executable during ahead-of-time compilation, the native-image tool needs to be made aware of any dynamically accessed Java code at run time, via reflection, as well as the native code which may be invoked. (Learn more here).This can be done by providing the JSON-based metadata collected by the agent. Any dynamically-accessed JCA services through Jipher are automatically registered by the agent too.The steps below show how to embedded Jipher in a native executable, using a simple Java application that does some RSA based signature creation and validation.      Save the following code into the file named JipherExample.java:     import java.security.*; import java.util.*; import com.oracle.jipher.provider.*; class JipherExample {     public static void main(String[] args) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, SignatureException {         Provider jipher = new JipherJCE();         Security.insertProviderAt(jipher, 1);         byte[] data = new byte[1024];         new Random().nextBytes(data);         KeyPairGenerator keyGen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(&quot;RSA&quot;, jipher);         keyGen.initialize(4096);         KeyPair keypair = keyGen.generateKeyPair();                     Signature signer = Signature.getInstance(&quot;SHA512withRSA&quot;, jipher);         signer.initSign(keypair.getPrivate());         signer.update(data);         byte[] signature = signer.sign();                     Signature verifier = Signature.getInstance(&quot;SHA512withRSA&quot;, jipher);         verifier.initVerify(keypair.getPublic());         verifier.update(data);         boolean isValid = verifier.verify(signature);         assert(isValid);     } }        Compile the application with Jipher JARs on the classpath:     javac -cp $GRAALVM_HOME/lib/jipher/jipher-jce.jar:$GRAALVM_HOME/lib/jipher/jipher-pki.jar JipherExample.java        Run the application on the JVM with the agent enabled. The tracing agent captures and writes down all the dynamic features encountered during a test run into multiple *-config.json files.     java java -cp $GRAALVM_HOME/lib/jipher/jipher-jce.jar:$GRAALVM_HOME/lib/jipher/jipher-pki.jar:. -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=&amp;lt;path&amp;gt; JipherExample    Where &amp;lt;path&amp;gt; should point to the directory in which to store the configuration files. It is recommended that the output directory is /META-INF/native-image/ (if you build with Maven or Gradle, then /resources/META-INF/native-image/).  Later, when building a native executable, the native-image builder will pick up the files from that location automatically.    For this Java application, the agent creates multiple configuration files. The ones to check are:          resource-config.json: Jipher bundles the OpenSSL libraries (for all supported platforms) within the JAR. This file lists entries for libjipher.so, fips.so, and openssl.cnf along with the corresponding checksum files. The specific entries pertain to the platform on which the agent is run, and should correspond to the platform for which the native executable is built. For example, on Linux x64, the content should be similar to:          {  &quot;resources&quot;:{  &quot;includes&quot;:[      {      &quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;Qlibs/linux_x64/fips.so.crc32E&quot;      },      {      &quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;Qlibs/linux_x64/fips.soE&quot;      },      {      &quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;Qlibs/linux_x64/libjipher.so.crc32E&quot;      },      {      &quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;Qlibs/linux_x64/libjipher.soE&quot;      },      {      &quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;Qlibs/linux_x64/openssl.cnf.crc32E&quot;      },      {      &quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;Qlibs/linux_x64/openssl.cnfE&quot;      },      {      &quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;QlibsE&quot;      }  ]},  &quot;bundles&quot;:[]  }            jni-config.json: This file lists entries from Jipher internal OpenSSL packages for Java classes with native method declarations. The content should be similar to:          {  &quot;name&quot;:&quot;[B&quot;}  ,  {  &quot;name&quot;:&quot;[[B&quot;}  ,  {  &quot;name&quot;:&quot;com.oracle.jipher.internal.openssl.JniOpenSsl&quot;}  ,  {  &quot;name&quot;:&quot;java.lang.Boolean&quot;,  &quot;methods&quot;:[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;getBoolean&quot;,&quot;parameterTypes&quot;:[&quot;java.lang.String&quot;] }]  }            reflect-config.json: This file lists entries from Jipher internal SPI packages for Java classes which implement the JCE SPI. The content should be similar to:          [  {  &quot;name&quot;:&quot;com.oracle.jipher.internal.spi.KeyPairGen$Rsa&quot;,  &quot;methods&quot;:[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;&amp;lt;init&amp;gt;&quot;,&quot;parameterTypes&quot;:[] }]}  ,  {  &quot;name&quot;:&quot;com.oracle.jipher.internal.spi.RsaDigestSig$Sha512WithRsa&quot;,  &quot;methods&quot;:[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;&amp;lt;init&amp;gt;&quot;,&quot;parameterTypes&quot;:[] }]}  ,  ...]                  For the agent to discover all possible calls to Jipher, re-run the application with the agent on the JVM (you can re-run the agent as many times as needed). This will rgenerate the entire configuration suite including any negative test cases (to allow for exception classes to be captured). For the subsequent runs, use this command:     java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-merge-dir=&amp;lt;path&amp;gt; JipherExample    The config-merge-dir command will merge the new configuration with configuration from previous test runs.        Build a native executable with the provided configuration:     native-image JipherExample    If the configuration files have been placed in a different directory than /META-INF/native-image/, pass this flag -H:ConfigurationFileDirectories=&amp;lt;path&amp;gt; at build time to inform the native-image tool of a new location:     native-image -H:ConfigurationFileDirectories=&amp;lt;path&amp;gt; JipherExample        Run the native executable:     ./jipherexample  When Jipher is not embedded in a native executable, but is instead being loaded by the JVM, it extracts the native libraries and the openssl.cnf file embedded in the JAR to the filesystem and then dynamically loads them into the JVM process. When Jipher is embedded in a native executable, it continues to extract the native libraries and the openssl.cnf file to the filesystem and dynamically load them into the native process.Jipher is recommended for GraalVM Native Image when only FIPS-allowed algorithm should be used.

          "title": "LLVM Backend for Native Image",
          "content": "LLVM Backend for Native ImageNative Image provides an alternative backend that uses the LLVM intermediate representation and the LLVM compiler to produce native executables.This LLVM backend enables users to target alternative architectures that are not directly supported by GraalVM Native Image. However, this approach introduces some performance costs.Installing and UsageThe LLVM Backend is not included by default as part of Native Image. To use it, you need to build GraalVM from source using the following mx commands:mx --dynamicimports /substratevm buildexport JAVA_HOME=$(mx --dynamicimports /substratevm graalvm-home)To enable the LLVM backend, pass the -H:CompilerBackend=llvm option to the native-image command.Code Generation Options  -H:+BitcodeOptimizations: enables aggressive optimizations at the LLVM bitcode level. This is experimental and may cause bugs.Debugging Options  -H:TempDirectory=: specifies where the files generated by Native Image will be saved. The LLVM files are saved under SVM-&amp;lt;timestamp&amp;gt;/llvm in this folder.  -H:LLVMMaxFunctionsPerBatch=: specifies the maximum size of a compilation batch*. Setting it to 1 compiles every function separately, 0 compiles everything as a single batch.  -H:DumpLLVMStackMap=: specifies a file in which to dump debugging information, including a mapping between compiled functions and the name of the corresponding bitcode file.About batches: LLVM compilation happens in four phases:  LLVM bitcode files (named f0.bc, f1.bc, etc.,) are created for each function.  The bitcode files are linked into batches (named b0.bc, b1.bc, etc.). This phase is skipped when -H:LLVMMaxFunctionsPerBatch=1 is specified.  The batches are optimized (into b0o.bc, b1o.bc, etc.,) and then compiled (into b0.o, b1.o, etc.).  The compiled batches are linked into a single object file (llvm.o), which is then linked into the final executable.How to Add a Target Architecture to GraalVM Using LLVM BackendAn interesting use case for the LLVM backend is to target a new architecture without having to implement a completely new backend for Native Image.The following are the necessary steps to achieve this at the moment.Target-Specific LLVM SettingsThere are a few instances where the GraalVM code has to go deeper than the target-independent nature of LLVM.These are most notably inline assembly snippets to implement direct register accesses and direct register jumps (for trampolines), as well as precisions about the structure of the stack frames of the code emitted by LLVM.This represents less than a dozen simple values to be set for each new target.(Complete set of values for AArch64)LLVM Statepoint SupportWhile the LLVM backend uses mostly common, well-supported features of LLVM, garbage collection support implies the use of statepoint intrinsics, an experimental feature of LLVM.This means that supporting a new architecture will require the implementation of statepoints in LLVM for the requested target.As most of the statepoint logic is handled at the bitcode level, i.e., at a target-independent stage, this is mostly a matter of emitting the right type of calls to lower the statepoint intrinsics.(Implementation of statepoints for AArch64)Object File SupportThe data section for programs created with the LLVM backend of the Graal compiler is emitted independently from the code, which is handled by LLVM.This means that the Graal compiler needs an understanding of object file relocations for the target architecture to be able to link the LLVM-compiled code with the GraalVM-generated data section.(see ELFMachine$ELFAArch64Relocations for an example)Further Reading  Native Image Basics",

          "title": "Memory Management",
          "content": "Memory ManagementA native image, when being executed, does not run on the Java HotSpot VM but on the runtime system provided with GraalVM.That runtime includes all necessary components, and one of them is the memory management.Java objects that a native image allocates at run time reside in the area called “the Java heap”.The Java heap is created when the native image starts up, and may increase or decrease in size while the native image runs.When the heap becomes full, a garbage collection is triggered to reclaim memory of objects that are no longer used.For managing the Java heap, Native Image provides different garbage collector (GC) implementations:  The Serial GC is the default GC in GraalVM Native Image.It is optimized for low memory footprint and small Java heap sizes.  The G1 GC is a multi-threaded GC that is optimized to reduce stop-the-world pauses and therefore improve latency, while achieving high throughput.To enable it, pass the option --gc=G1 to the native-image builder.Currently, G1 Garbage Collector can be used with Native Image on the Linux AMD64 and AArch64 architectures. (Not available in GraalVM Community Edition.)  The Epsilon GC (available with GraalVM 21.2 or later) is a no-op garbage collector that does not do any garbage collection and therefore never frees any allocated memory.The primary use case for this GC are very short running applications that only allocate a small amount of memory.To enable the Epsilon GC, specify the option --gc=epsilon at image build time.Performance ConsiderationsThe primary metrics for garbage collection are throughput, latency, and footprint:  Throughput is the percentage of total time not spent in garbage collection considered over long periods of time.  Latency is the responsiveness of an application.Garbage collection pauses negatively affect the responsiveness.  Footprint is the working set of a process, measured in pages and cache lines.Choosing settings for the Java heap is always a trade-off between these metrics.For example, a very large young generation may maximize throughput, but does so at the expense of footprint and latency.Young generation pauses can be minimized by using a small young generation at the expense of throughput.By default, Native Image automatically determines values for the Java heap settings that are listed below.The exact values may depend on the system configuration and the used GC.  The maximum Java heap size defines the upper limit for the size of the whole Java heap.If the Java heap is full and the GC is unable reclaim sufficient memory for a Java object allocation, the allocation will fail with the OutOfMemoryError.Note: The maximum heap size is only the upper limit for the Java heap and not necessarily the upper limit for the total amount of consumed memory, as Native Image places some data such as thread stacks, just-in-time compiled code (for Truffle runtime compilation), and internal data structures in memory that is separate from the Java heap.  The minimum Java heap size defines how much memory the GC may always assume as reserved for the Java heap, no matter how little of that memory is actually used.  The young generation size determines the amount of Java memory that can be allocated without triggering a garbage collection.Serial Garbage CollectorThe Serial GC is optimized for low footprint and small Java heap sizes.If no other GC is specified, the Serial GC will be used implicitly as the default on GraalVM.It is also possible to explicitly enable the Serial GC by passing the option --gc=serial to the native image builder.# Build a native image that uses the serial GC with default settingsnative-image --gc=serial HelloWorldOverviewIn its core, the Serial GC is a simple (non-parallel, non-concurrent) stop and copy GC.It divides the Java heap into a young and an old generation.Each generation consists of a set of equally sized chunks, each a contiguous range of virtual memory.Those chunks are the GC-internal unit for memory allocation and memory reclamation.The young generation contains recently created objects and is divided into the eden and survivor regions.New objects are allocated in the eden region, and when this region is full, a young collection is triggered.Objects that are alive in the eden region will be moved to the survivor region, and alive objects in the survivor region stay in that region until they reach a certain age (have survived a certain number of collections), at which time they are moved to the old generation.When the old generation becomes full, a full collection is triggered that reclaims the space of unused objects in both the young and old generations.Typically, a young collection is much faster than a full collection, however doing full collections is important for keeping the memory footprint low.By default, the Serial GC tries to find a size for the generations that provides good throughput, but to not increase sizes further when doing so gives diminishing returns.It also tries to maintain a ratio between the time spent in young collections and in full collections to keep the footprint small.If no maximum Java heap size is specified, a native image that uses the Serial GC will set its maximum Java heap size to 80% of the physical memory size.For example, on a machine with 4GB of RAM, the maximum Java heap size will be set to 3.2GB.If the same image is executed on a machine that has 32GB of RAM, the maximum Java heap size will be set to 25.6GB.Note that this is just the maximum value.Depending on the application, the amount of actually used Java heap memory can be much lower.To override this default behavior, either specify a value for -XX:MaximumHeapSizePercent or explicitly set the maximum Java heap size.Note that GraalVM releases up to (and including) 21.3 use a different default configuration for the Serial GC with no survivor regions, a young generation that is limited to 256 MB, and a default collection policy that balances the time that is spent in young collections and old collections.This configuration can be enabled with: -H:InitialCollectionPolicy=BySpaceAndTimeBe mindful that the GC needs some extra memory when performing a garbage collection (2x of the maximum heap size is the worst case, usually, it is significantly less).Therefore, the resident set size, RSS, can increase temporarily during a garbage collection which can be an issue in any environment with memory constraints (such as a container).Performance TuningFor tuning the GC performance and the memory footprint, the following options can be used:  -XX:MaximumHeapSizePercent - the percentage of the physical memory size that is used as the maximum Java heap size if the maximum Java heap size is not specified otherwise.  -XX:MaximumYoungGenerationSizePercent - the maximum size of the young generation as a percentage of the maximum Java heap size.  -XX:±CollectYoungGenerationSeparately (since GraalVM 21.0) - determines if a full GC collects the young generation separately or together with the old generation.If enabled, this may reduce the memory footprint during full GCs.However, full GCs may take more time.  -XX:MaxHeapFree (since GraalVM 21.3) - maximum total size (in bytes) of free memory chunks that remain reserved for allocations after a collection and are therefore not returned to the operating system.  -H:AlignedHeapChunkSize (can only be specified at image build time) - the size of a heap chunk in bytes.  -H:MaxSurvivorSpaces (since GraalVM 21.1, can only be specified at image build time) - the number of survivor spaces that are used for the young generation, that is, the maximum age at which an object will be promoted to the old generation.With a value of 0, objects that survive a young collection are directly promoted to the old generation.  -H:LargeArrayThreshold (can only be specified at image build time) - the size at or above which an array will be allocated in its own heap chunk.Arrays that are considered as large are more expensive to allocate but they are never copied by the GC, which can reduce the GC overhead.# Build and execute a native image that uses a maximum heap size of 25% of the physical memorynative-image --gc=serial -R:MaximumHeapSizePercent=25 HelloWorld./helloworld# Execute the native image from above but increase the maximum heap size to 75% of the physical memory./helloworld -XX:MaximumHeapSizePercent=75The following options are available with -H:InitialCollectionPolicy=BySpaceAndTime only:  -XX:PercentTimeInIncrementalCollection - determines how much time the GC should spend doing young collections.With the default value of 50, the GC tries to balance the time spent on young and full collections.Increasing this value will reduce the number of full GCs, which can improve performance but may worsen the memory footprint.Decreasing this value will increase the number of full GCs, which can improve the memory footprint but may decrease performance.G1 Garbage CollectorOracle GraalVM also provides the Garbage-First (G1) garbage collector, which is based on the G1 GC from the Java HotSpot VM.Currently, G1 Garbage Collector can be used with Native Image on the Linux AMD64 and AArch64 architectures. (Not available in GraalVM Community Edition.)To enable it, pass the option --gc=G1 to the native-image builder.# Build a native image that uses the G1 GC with default settingsnative-image --gc=G1 HelloWorldNote: In GraalVM 20.0, 20.1, and 20.2, the G1 GC was called low-latency GC and could be enabled via the experimental option -H:+UseLowLatencyGC.OverviewG1 is a generational, incremental, parallel, mostly concurrent, stop-the-world, and evacuating GC.It aims to provide the best balance between latency and throughput.Some operations are always performed in stop-the-world pauses to improve throughput.Other operations that would take more time with the application stopped, such as whole-heap operations like global marking, are performed in parallel and concurrently with the application.The G1 GC tries to meet set pause-time targets with high probability over a longer time.However, there is no absolute certainty for a given pause.G1 partitions the heap into a set of equally sized heap regions, each a contiguous range of virtual memory.A region is the GC-internal unit for memory allocation and memory reclamation.At any given time, each of these regions can be empty, or assigned to a particular generation.If no maximum Java heap size is specified, a native image that uses the G1 GC will set its maximum Java heap size to 25% of the physical memory size.For example, on a machine with 4GB of RAM, the maximum Java heap size will be set to 1GB.If the same image is executed on a machine that has 32GB of RAM, the maximum Java heap size will be set to 8GB.To override this default behavior, either specify a value for -XX:MaxRAMPercentage or explicitly set the maximum Java heap size.Performance TuningThe G1 GC is an adaptive garbage collector with defaults that enable it to work efficiently without modification.However, it can be tuned to the performance needs of a particular application.Here is a small subset of the options that can be specified when doing performance tuning:  -H:G1HeapRegionSize (can only be specified at image build time) - the size of a G1 region.  -XX:MaxRAMPercentage - the percentage of the physical memory size that is used as the maximum heap size if the maximum heap size is not specified otherwise.  -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis - the goal for the maximum pause time.  -XX:ParallelGCThreads - the maximum number of threads used for parallel work during garbage collection pauses.  -XX:ConcGCThreads - the maximum number of threads used for concurrent work.  -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent - the Java heap occupancy threshold that triggers a marking cycle.  -XX:G1HeapWastePercent - the allowed unreclaimed space in the collection set candidates. G1 stops the space-reclamation phase if the free space in the collection set candidates is lower than that.# Build and execute a native image that uses the G1 GC with a region size of 2MB and a maximum pause time goal of 100msnative-image --gc=G1 -H:G1RegionSize=2m -R:MaxGCPauseMillis=100 HelloWorld./helloworld# Execute the native image from above and override the maximum pause time goal./helloworld -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=50Memory Management OptionsThis section describes the most important memory management command-line options that are independent of the used GC.For all numeric values the suffix k, m, or g can be used for scaling.Further options to the native image builder can be listed using native-image --expert-options-all.Java Heap SizeWhen executing a native image, suitable Java heap settings will be determined automatically based on the system configuration and the used GC.To override this automatic mechanism and to explicitly set the heap size at run time, the following command-line options can be used:  -Xmx - maximum heap size in bytes  -Xms - minimum heap size in bytes  -Xmn - the size of the young generation in bytesIt is also possible to preconfigure default heap settings at image build time.The specified values will then be used as the default values at run time:  -R:MaxHeapSize (since GraalVM 20.0) - maximum heap size in bytes  -R:MinHeapSize (since GraalVM 20.0) - minimum heap size in bytes  -R:MaxNewSize (since GraalVM 20.0) - size of the young generation in bytes# Build a native image with the default heap settings and override the heap settings at run timenative-image HelloWorld./helloworld -Xms2m -Xmx10m -Xmn1m# Build a native image and &quot;bake&quot; heap settings into the image. The specified values will be used at run timenative-image -R:MinHeapSize=2m -R:MaxHeapSize=10m -R:MaxNewSize=1m HelloWorld./helloworldCompressed ReferencesOracle GraalVM supports compressed references to Java objects that use 32-bit instead of 64-bit.Compressed references are enabled by default and can have a large impact on the memory footprint.However, they limit the maximum Java heap size to 32 GB of memory.If more than 32 GB are needed, compressed references need to be disabled.  -H:±UseCompressedReferences (can only be specified at image build time) - determines if 32-bit instead of 64-bit references to Java objects are used.Native MemoryNative Image may also allocate memory that is separate from the Java heap.One common use-case is a java.nio.DirectByteBuffer that directly references native memory.  -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize - the maximum size of direct buffer allocations.Printing Garbage CollectionsWhen executing a native image, the following options can be be used to print some information on garbage collection.Which data is printed in detail depends on the used GC.  -XX:+PrintGC - print basic information for every garbage collection  -XX:+VerboseGC - can be added to print further garbage collection details# Execute a native image and print basic garbage collection information./helloworld -XX:+PrintGC# Execute a native image and print detailed garbage collection information./helloworld -XX:+PrintGC -XX:+VerboseGCFurther Reading  Memory Configuration for Native Image Build",

          "title": "Truffle languages and instruments migration to Java modules",
          "content": "Truffle languages and instruments migration to Java modulesSince version 23.1 Truffle uses languages and instruments primarily as Java modules loaded from the Java VM module-path.Loading languages and tools from language or tool homes is still supported for compatibility reasons. However, it isdeprecated and will be removed in future versions. The motivations for this change are:  Truffle should be used the same way on all JDKs.  Truffle is not a part of the Java VM jimage and is used as a regular JVM VM module-path library.  Loading languages and tools from the module path is much easier for the embedder and works right out of the box withtools like Apache Maven.  The Java module system guarantees strong encapsulation and reliable configuration.Module MigrationFor general information on migrating to Java modules, please refer to development-with-jdk-9.The Truffle module is distributed in two versions: open Truffle and closed Truffle. The open Truffle exports all APIpackages in its module descriptor. On the other hand, the closed Truffle does not export API packages in the moduledescriptor. Instead, it dynamically exports API packages at runtime to modules that provide the language or instrument,as well as to modules that the language or instrument module reads. While the open Truffle is intended for testing andcompile-time purposes, the closed Truffle must be used in production. To correctly load a language or instrument as amodule, the following migration steps need to be applied:  Define a named Java module that requires the org.graalvm.truffle module.  For each Truffle language provided by this module, register a language provider using the  provides TruffleLanguageProvider with &amp;lt;LanguageClass&amp;gt;Provider directive.  For each Truffle instrument provided by this module, register an instrument provider using the  provides TruffleInstrumentProvider with &amp;lt;InstrumentClass&amp;gt;Provider directive.  If a library is exported with a default export lookup enabled using @GenerateLibrary(defaultExportLookupEnabled = true),the generated implementation of the DefaultExportProvider must be registered in the module descriptor using the providesdirective for the com.oracle.truffle.api.library.provider.DefaultExportProvider service. If you build your language or instrument using mxthe provides directive is generated automatically.  If an AOT library is exported using @ExportLibrary(useForAOT = true), the generated implementation of the EagerExportProvidermust be registered in the module descriptor using the provides directive for the com.oracle.truffle.api.library.provider.EagerExportProviderservice. If you build your language or instrument using mx the provides directive is generated automatically.  If your language or instrument already has a module descriptor, make sure that it does not provide any implementationof a deprecated com.oracle.truffle.api.library.EagerExportProvider or com.oracle.truffle.api.library.DefaultExportProviderinterface in the module descriptor. They must be replaced by the com.oracle.truffle.api.library.provider.EagerExportProvider andcom.oracle.truffle.api.library.provider.DefaultExportProvider. Providing these deprecated interfaces in the module descriptorwill cause an error during  creation of a module layer on the closed Truffle.  Languages or instruments must not provide JDK services or services from third party libraries in the module descriptor.This is needed to avoid languages getting loaded by the JDK or third parties without the necessary dynamic exports.  Language dependencies that might be commonly used by Java applications, like ICU4J, should be shadowed to avoidconflicts with modules used by the embedding.  If the language or instrument does not expose any API, it is recommended to keep the module as encapsulated as possibleand avoid exporting any packages. Otherwise, export the API packages. In the case of internal APIs that are exclusivelyutilized by known modules, it is advised to use qualified exports with the syntax export &amp;lt;package&amp;gt; to &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;.Here is a sample module descriptor for the simple language.module org.graalvm.sl {  requires java.base;  requires java.logging;  requires jdk.unsupported;  requires org.antlr.antlr4.runtime;  requires org.graalvm.truffle;  provides  com.oracle.truffle.api.provider.TruffleLanguageProvider with    com.oracle.truffle.sl.SLLanguageProvider;}",

          "title": "Using JavaScript Modules and Packages in GraalVM JavaScript",
          "content": "Using JavaScript Modules and Packages in GraalVM JavaScriptGraalVM JavaScript is compatible with the latest ECMAScript standard, and can be executed in a variety of embedding scenarios such as Java-based applications or Node.js.Depending on the GraalVM’s JavaScript embedding scenario, JavaScript packages and modules may be used in different ways.Node.jsGraalVM ships with a specific Node.js version that it is compatible with.Applications can therefore freely import and use NPM packages compatible with the supported Node.js version, including CommonJS, ES modules, and modules that use native bindings.To check and verify the Node.js version supported by GraalVM, simply run bin/node --version.Java-based Applications (Context API)When embedded in a Java application (using the Context API), GraalVM JavaScript can execute JavaScript applications and modules that do not depend on Node.js’ built-in modules such as &#39;fs&#39;, &#39;events&#39;, or &#39;http&#39; or Node.js-specific functions such as setTimeout() or setInterval().On the other hand, modules that depend on such Node.js builtins cannot be loaded in a GraalVM polyglot Context.Supported NPM packages can be used in a GraalVM JavaScript Context using one of the following approaches:  Using a package bundler.For example, to combine multiple NPM packages in a single JavaScript Source file.  Using ES modules on the local FileSystem.Optionally, a custom Truffle FileSystem can be used to configure how files are resolved.By default, a Java Context does not support loading modules using the CommonJS require() function.This is because require() is a Node.js built-in function, and is not part of the ECMAScript specification.Experimental support for CommonJS modules can be enabled through the js.commonjs-require option as described below.ECMAScript Modules (ESM)GraalVM JavaScript supports the full ES modules specification, including import statements, dynamic import of modules using import(), and advanced features such as top-level await.ECMAScript modules can be loaded in a Context simply by evaluating the module sources.GraalVM JavaScript loads ECMAScript modules based on their file extension.Therefore, any ECMAScript module should have file name extension .mjs.Alternatively, the module Source should have Mime type &quot;application/javascript+module&quot;.As an example, let’s assume that you have a file named foo.mjs containing the following simple ES module:export class Foo {    square(x) {        return x * x;    }}The ES module can be loaded in a polyglot Context in the following way:public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {    String src = &quot;import {Foo} from &#39;/path/to/foo.mjs&#39;;&quot; +                 &quot;const foo = new Foo();&quot; +                 &quot;console.log(foo.square(42));&quot;;    Context cx = Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;)                .allowIO(true)                .build();cx.eval(Source.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;, src, &quot;test.mjs&quot;).build());}Note that the ES module file has .mjs extension.Also note that the allowIO() option is provided to enable IO access.More examples of ES modules usage are available here.Experimental module namespace exportsThe --js.esm-eval-returns-exports experimental option can be used to expose the ES module namespace exported object to a Polyglot Context.This can be handy when an ES module is used directly from Java:public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {    String code = &quot;export const foo = 42;&quot;;    Context cx = Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;)                .allowIO(true)                .option(&quot;js.esm-eval-returns-exports&quot;, &quot;true&quot;)                .build();    Source source = Source.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;, code)                .mimeType(&quot;application/javascript+module&quot;)                .build();    Value exports = cx.eval(source);    // now the `exports` object contains the ES module exported symbols.    System.out.println(exports.getMember(&quot;foo&quot;).toString()); // prints `42`}The option is disabled by default.Truffle FileSystemBy default, GraalVM JavaScript uses the built-in FileSystem of the polyglot Context to load and resolve ES modules.A FileSystem can be used to customize the ES modules loading process.For example, a custom FileSystem can be used to resolve ES modules using URLs:Context cx = Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;).fileSystem(new FileSystem() {private final Path TMP = Paths.get(&quot;/some/tmp/path&quot;);    @Override    public Path parsePath(URI uri) {    // If the URL matches, return a custom (internal) Path    if (&quot;http://localhost/foo&quot;.equals(uri.toString())) {        return TMP;} else {        return Paths.get(uri);        }    }@Override    public SeekableByteChannel newByteChannel(Path path, Set&amp;lt;? extends OpenOption&amp;gt; options, FileAttribute&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;... attrs) throws IOException {    if (TMP.equals(path)) {        String moduleBody = &quot;export class Foo {&quot; +                            &quot;        square(x) {&quot; +                            &quot;            return x * x;&quot; +                            &quot;        }&quot; +                            &quot;    }&quot;;            // Return a dynamically-generated file for the ES module.            return createByteChannelFrom(moduleBody);        }    }    /* Other FileSystem methods not shown */}).allowIO(true).build();String src = &quot;import {Foo} from &#39;http://localhost/foo&#39;;&quot; +             &quot;const foo = new Foo();&quot; +             &quot;console.log(foo.square(42));&quot;;cx.eval(Source.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;, src, &quot;test.mjs&quot;).build());In this simple example, a custom FileSystem is used to load a dynamically-generated ES module when an application attempts to import the http://localhost/foo URL.A complete example of a custom Truffle FileSystem to load ES modules can be found here.CommonJS Modules (CJS)By default, the Context API does not support CommonJS modules, and has no built-in require() function.In order to be loaded and used from a Context in Java, a CommonJS module needs to be bundled into a self-contained JavaScript source file.This can be done using one of the many popular open-source bundling tools such as Parcel, Browserify, and Webpack.Experimental support for CommonJS modules can be enabled through the js.commonjs-require option as described below.Experimental support for CommonJS NPM modules in the Context APIThe js.commonjs-require option provides a built-in require() function that can be used to load NPM-compatible CommonJS modules in a JavaScript Context.Currently, this is an experimental feature not for production usage.To enable CommonJS support, a JavaScript context can be created in the following way:Map&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt; options = new HashMap&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();// Enable CommonJS experimental support.options.put(&quot;js.commonjs-require&quot;, &quot;true&quot;);// (optional) folder where the NPM modules to be loaded are located.options.put(&quot;js.commonjs-require-cwd&quot;, &quot;/path/to/root/folder&quot;);// (optional) Node.js built-in replacements as a comma separated list.options.put(&quot;js.commonjs-core-modules-replacements&quot;,            &quot;buffer:buffer/,&quot; +            &quot;path:path-browserify&quot;);// Create context with IO support and experimental options.Context cx = Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;)                            .allowExperimentalOptions(true)                            .allowIO(true)                            .options(options)                            .build();// Require a moduleValue module = cx.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;require(&#39;some-module&#39;);&quot;);The &quot;js.commonjs-require-cwd&quot; option can be used to specify the main folder where NPM packages have been installed.As an example, this can be the folder where the npm install command was executed, or the folder containing your main node_modules folder.Any NPM module will be resolved relative to that folder, including any built-in replacement specified using &quot;js.commonjs-core-modules-replacements&quot;.Differences with Node.js built-in require() functionThe Context built-in require() function can load regular NPM modules implemented in JavaScript, but cannot load native NPM modules.The built-in require() relies on the FileSystem, therefore I/O access needs to be enabled at context creation time using the allowIO option.The built-in require() aims to be largely compatible with Node.js, and we expect it to work with any NPM module that would work in a browser (e.g., created using a package bundler).Installing an NPM module to be used via the Context APIIn order to be used from a JavaScript Context, an NPM module needs to be installed to a local folder.This can be done using GraalVM JavaScript’s npm install command like one would normally do for Node.js applications.At runtime, the option js.commonjs-require-cwd can be used to specify the main installation folder for NPM packages.The require() built-in function will resolve packages according to the default Node.js’ package resolution protocol starting from the directory specified via js.commonjs-require-cwd.When no directory is provided with the option, the current working directory of the application will be used.Node.js core modules mockupsSome JavaScript applications or NPM modules might need functionalities that are available in Node.js’ built-in modules (e.g., &#39;fs&#39; and &#39;buffer&#39;, etc.).Such modules are not available in the Context API.Thankfully, the Node.js community has developed high-quality JavaScript implementations for many Node.js core modules (e.g., the ‘buffer’ module for the browser).Such alternative module implementations can be exposed to a JavaScript Context using the js.commonjs-core-modules-replacements option, in the following way:options.put(&quot;js.commonjs-core-modules-replacements&quot;, &quot;buffer:my-buffer-implementation&quot;);As the code suggests, the option instructs the GraalVM JavaScript runtime to load a module called my-buffer-implementation when an application attempts to load the Node.js &#39;buffer&#39; built-in module using require(&#39;buffer&#39;).Global symbols pre-initializationAn NPM module or a JavaScript application might expect certain global properties to be defined in the global scope.For example, applications or modules might expect the Buffer global symbol to be defined in the JavaScript global object.To this end, the application user code can use globalThis to patch the application’s global scope:// define an empty object called &#39;process&#39;globalThis.process = {};// define the &#39;Buffer&#39; global symbolglobalThis.Buffer = require(&#39;some-buffer-implementation&#39;).Buffer;// import another module that might use &#39;Buffer&#39;require(&#39;another-module&#39;);",

          "content": "Monomorphization Use CasesThis guide demonstrates through examples how monomorphization can improve performance of dynamic languages without going into any detail on how monomorphization is implemented (described in the Splitting guide) or how to leverage monomorphization in your language implementation (described in the Reporting Polymorphism guide).MonomorphizationTo better illustrate the benefits of monomorphization, consider a small example written in JavaScript:function add(arg1, arg2) {    return arg1 + arg2;}function callsAdd() {    add(1, 2);    add(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;);}var i = 0;while (i &amp;lt; 1000) {    callsAdd();    i++;}As you can see in this example, the add function is called from callsAdd once with integer arguments and once with string arguments.Once add is executed enough times to be compiled its execution profile will show that the + operator has been executed with both integers and strings and thus handlers (i.e., type checks and execution) for both types will be compiled which has aperformance impact.This can be avoided by rewriting the example as follows:function addInt(arg1, arg2) {    return arg1 + arg2;}function addString(arg1, arg2) {    return arg1 + arg2;}function callsAdd() {    addInt(1, 2);    addString(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;);}i = 0;while (i &amp;lt; 1000) {    callsAdd();    i++;}In this example the add has been duplicated (split) in such a way that each type profile is contained in a separate copy of the function (addInt and addString).The result is that, come compilation time, only a single type profile is available for each function avoiding potentially costly type checks in the compiled code.Automating the detection suitable candidates, as well as their duplication, performed at run time is what we call monomorphization.It is, in other words, automated run-time monomorphization of polymorphic nodes through AST duplication.Example 1 - Monomorphization of ArgumentsThis example is an extended version of the illustration example from the previous section.The add function is still the target for monomorphization and is called from the action function 3 times with 3 sets of different arguments (numbers, strings and arrays).Execute the action function for 15 seconds in order to have enough time for warmup, and afterwards execute it for 60 seconds keeping track of how long each execution took, reporting finally the average.Execute this code twice: once with and once without monomorphization enabled and report the output of these two runs as well as the speedup.function add(arg1, arg2) {    return arg1 + arg2;}var global = 0;function action() {    for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; 10000; i++) {        global = add(1, 2);        global = add(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;);        global = add([1,2,3], [4,5,6]);    }}// Warm up.var start = Date.now();while ((Date.now() - start) &amp;lt; 15000 /* 15 seconds */) {    action();}// Benchmarkvar iterations = 0;var sum = 0;var start = Date.now();while ((Date.now() - start) &amp;lt; 60000 /* 60 seconds */) {    var thisIterationStart = Date.now();    action();    var thisIterationTime = Date.now() - thisIterationStart;    iterations++;    sum += thisIterationTime;}console.log(sum / iterations);The output without monomorphization is 4.494225288735564.The output with monomorphization is 4.2421633923.The speedup is ~5%.Example 2 - Monomorphization of Indirect CallsThis example is slightly more complicated and illustrates how monomorphization benefits higher order functions. In the example, the insertionSort function is defined, which - given an array of items and a function for comparing these items - sorts the array using insertion sort.Define an array of 1000 random double values between 0 and 1 and sort it four times using 4 different sorting methods (in the action function).Finally, as with the previous example, warm up the action function for 15 second, and report the average execution time ofthis function over the next 60 seconds with and without monomorphization.function insertionSort (items, comparator) {    for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; items.length; i++) {        let value = items[i];        for (var j = i - 1; j &amp;gt;= 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; comparator(items[j], value); j--) {            items[j + 1] = items[j]        }        items[j + 1] = value    }}// Random values in an arrayvar array = new Array(1000);for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; array.length; i++) {    array[i] = Math.random();}function action() {    insertionSort(array, function (a, b) { return a &amp;lt; b                                      });    insertionSort(array, function (a, b) { return a &amp;gt; b                                      });    insertionSort(array, function (a, b) { return a.toString().length &amp;lt; b.toString().length; });    insertionSort(array, function (a, b) { return a.toString().length &amp;gt; b.toString().length; });}// Warm up.var start = Date.now();while ((Date.now() - start) &amp;lt; 15000 /* 15 seconds */) {    action();}// Benchmarkvar iterations = 0;var sum = 0;var start = Date.now();while ((Date.now() - start) &amp;lt; 60000 /* 60 seconds */) {    var thisIterationStart = Date.now();    action();    var thisIterationTime = Date.now() - thisIterationStart;    iterations++;    sum += thisIterationTime;}console.log(sum / iterations);The output without monomorphization is 194.05161290322582.The output with monomorphization is 175.41071428571428.The speedup is ~10%.",

          "content": "MultithreadingRunning JavaScript on GraalVM supports multithreading.Depending on the usage scenario, threads can be used to execute parallel JavaScript code using multiple Context objects, or multiple Worker threads.Multithreading with Java and JavaScriptMultithreading is supported when running JavaScript in the context of Java interoperability.The basic model of multi-threaded execution supported by GraalVM is a “share-nothing” model that should be familiar to any JavaScript developer:  An arbitrary number of JavaScript Contexts can be created, but they should be used by one thread at a time.  Concurrent access to JavaScript objects is not allowed: any JavaScript object cannot be accessed by more than one thread at a time.  Concurrent access to Java objects is allowed: any Java object can be accessed by any Java or JavaScript thread, concurrently.A JavaScript Context cannot be accessed by two or more threads, concurrently, but it is possible to access the same Context from multiple threads using proper syncronization, to ensure that concurrent access never happens.ExamplesThe GraalVM JavaScript unit tests contain several examples of multi-threaded Java/JavaScript interactions.The most notable ones describe how:  Multiple Context objects can be executed in multiple threads.  JavaScript values created by one thread can be used from another thread when proper synchronization is used.  A Context can be accessed from multiple threads when proper synchronization is used.  Java concurrency can be used from JavaScript.  Java objects can be accessed by multiple JavaScript threads, concurrently.Multithreading with Node.jsThe basic multithreading model of GraalVM JavaScript applies to Node.js applications as well.In Node.js, a Worker thread can be created to execute JavaScript code in parallel, but JavaScript objects cannot be shared between Workers.On the contrary, a Java object created with GraalVM Java interoperability (e.g., using Java.type()) can be shared between Node.js Workers.This allows multi-threaded Node.js applications to share Java objects.ExamplesThe GraalVM Node.js unit tests contain several examples of multi-threaded Node.js applications.The most notable examples show how:  Node.js worker threads can execute Java code.  Java objects can be shared between Node.js worker threads.  JavaScript Promise objects can be used to await on messages from workers, using Java objects to bind promises to worker messages.",

          "title": "Truffle Native Function Interface",
          "content": "Truffle Native Function InterfaceTruffle includes a way to call native functions, called the Native Function Interface (NFI).It is implemented as an internal language on top of Truffle that language implementors can access via the standard polyglot eval interface and Truffle interoperability.NFI is intended to be used, for example, to implement a language’s FFI, or to call native runtime routines that are not available in Java.NFI uses libffi.On a standard JVM it calls it using JNI, and on GraalVM Native Image it uses system Java.In the future it may be optimised by the Graal Compiler in native executables so that native calls are made directly from the compiled code.StabilityThe NFI is an internal language designed for language implementors.It is not considered stable and the interface and behavior may change without warning.It is not intended to be used directly by end-users.Basic ConceptsThe NFI is accessed via the polyglot interface of whatever language you are using.This could be Java, or it could be a Truffle language.This lets you use the NFI from both your Java language implementation code, or from your guest language to reduce the amount of Java that you need to write.The entry point is the polyglot eval interface.This runs a special DSL, and returns Truffle interoperability objects which can then expose more methods.Below are some examples using Ruby’s polyglot interface, but any other JVM or a language implementation could be used instead.Basic ExampleHere is a basic working example, before going into the details:library = Polyglot.eval(&#39;nfi&#39;, &#39;load &quot;libSDL2.dylib&quot;&#39;)  # load a librarysymbol = library[&#39;SDL_GetRevisionNumber&#39;]               # load a symbol from the librarysignature = Polyglot.eval(&#39;nfi&#39;, &#39;():UINT32&#39;)           # prepare a signaturefunction = signature.bind(symbol)                       # bind the symbol to the signature to create a functionputs function.call # =&amp;gt; 12373                           # call the functionLoading libariesTo load a library, a script written in the ‘nfi’ language DSL is evaluated.It returns an object that represents the loaded library.library = Polyglot.eval(&#39;nfi&#39;, &#39;...load command...&#39;)The load command can be any of these forms:  default  load &quot;filename&quot;  load (flag | flag | ...) &quot;filename&quot;The default command returns a pseudo-library that contains all symbols already loaded inthe process, equivalent to RTLD_DEFAULT in the Posix interface.The load &quot;filename&quot; command loads a library from a file.You are responsible for any cross-platform concerns about library naming conventions and load paths.The load (flag | flag | ...) &quot;filename&quot; command allows you to specify flags to load the library.For the default backend (backends will be described later), and when running on a Posix platform, the flags available are RTLD_GLOBAL, RTLD_LOCAL, RTLD_LAZY, and RTLD_NOW, which have the conventional Posix semantics.The default is RTLD_NOW if neither RTLD_LAZY nor RTLD_NOW were specified.Loading Symbols from LibrariesTo load a symbol from a library, read the symbol as a property from the library object that was previously loaded.symbol = library[&#39;symbol_name&#39;]Producing Native Function Objects from SymbolsTo get an executable object that you can call in order to invoke the native function, bind the symbol object that was previously loaded, by creating a signature object and calling the bind method on it.The signature object needs to match the native function’s actual type signature.signature = Polyglot.eval(&#39;nfi&#39;, &#39;...signature...&#39;)function = signature.bind(symbol)The format of the signature is (arg, arg, ...) : return, where arg and return are types.Types can be one of the simple types:  VOID  UINT8  SINT8  UINT16  SINT16  UINT32  SINT32  UINT64  SINT64  FLOAT  DOUBLE  POINTER  STRING  OBJECT  ENVArray types are formed by placing another type in square brackets.For example [UINT8]. These are C-style arrays.Function pointer types are formed by writing a nested signature.For example the signature of qsort would be (POINTER, UINT64, UINT64, (POINTER, POINTER) : SINT32) : VOID.For a function with a signature with variadic arguments, you specify ... where the variadic arguments start, but then you must specify the actual types that you will be calling the function with.You may therefore need to bind the same symbol multiple times in order to call it with different types or a different number of arguments.For example, to call printf with %d %f you would use the type signature (STRING, ...SINT32, DOUBLE) : SINT32.Type expressions can be nested arbitrarily deep.Two additional special types, ENV and OBJECT, are described in the section on the native API, later in this document.Types can be written in any case.You are responsible for any mapping of types from a foreign language such as C into NFI types.Calling Native Function ObjectsTo call a native function, execute it.return_value = function.call(...arguments...)Calling back from Native Code to Managed FunctionsUsing nested signatures, a function call can get function pointers as arguments.The managed caller needs to pass a Polyglot executable object, that will be converted to a native function pointer.When calling this function pointer from the native side, the execute message is sent to the Polyglot object.void native_function(int32_t (*fn)(int32_t)) {  printf(&quot;%dn&quot;, fn(15));}signature = Polyglot.eval(&#39;nfi&#39;, &#39;((SINT32):SINT32):VOID&#39;)native_function = signature.bind(library[&#39;native_function&#39;])native_function.call(-&amp;gt;(x) { x + 1 })The arguments and return values of callback functions are converted the same as for regular function calls, with the conversion in the other direction, i.e., arguments are converted from native to managed, and return values are converted from managed to native.Callback function pointers can themselves have function pointer arguments.That works as you would expect: the function accepts a native function pointer as argument, and it is converted to a Truffle executable object.Sending the execute message to that object calls the native function pointer, same as calling a regular NFI function.Function pointer types are also supported as return types.Combined Loading and BindingYou can optionally combine loading a library with loading symbols and binding them.This is achieved with an extended load command, which then returns an object with the already bound functions as methods.These two examples are equivalent:library = Polyglot.eval(&#39;nfi&#39;, &#39;load libSDL2.dylib&#39;)symbol = library[&#39;SDL_GetRevisionNumber&#39;]signature = Polyglot.eval(&#39;nfi&#39;, &#39;():UINT32&#39;)function = signature.bind(symbol)puts function.call # =&amp;gt; 12373library = Polyglot.eval(&#39;nfi&#39;, &#39;load libSDL2.dylib { SDL_GetRevisionNumber():UINT32; }&#39;)puts library.SDL_GetRevisionNumber # =&amp;gt; 12373The definitions in the curly braces {} can contain multiple function bindings, so that many functions can be loaded from a library at once.BackendsThe load command can be prefixed by with in order to select a specific NFI backend.Multiple NFI backends are available.The default is called native, and will be used if there is no with prefix, or the selected backend is not available.Depending on the configuration of components you are running, available backends may include:  native  llvm, which uses the GraalVM LLVM runtime to run the native code  panamaPanama backendThe Panama backend uses the Foreign Function and Memory APIs introduced by project Panama. This backend only supports a subset of all the types. Specifically, it does not support STRING, OBJECT, ENV, FP80 or array types.Although less feature-complete, the backend is typically more performant.Currently, it is available starting from JDK 21 with the --enable-preview tag.Truffle NFI on Native ImageTo build a native image that contains the Truffle NFI, it is sufficient to use the --language:nfi argument, or specify Requires = language:nfi in native-image.properties.It is possible to select what implementation to use for the native backend using --language:nfi=&amp;lt;backend&amp;gt;.Note that the --language:nfi=&amp;lt;backend&amp;gt; argument must come before any other arguments that might pull in the NFI as dependency via Requires = language:nfi.The first instance of language:nfi wins and determines what backend will be built into the native image.Available arguments for --language:nfi=&amp;lt;backend&amp;gt; are:  libffi (the default)  noneSelecting the none native backend will effectively disable access to native functions using the Truffle NFI.This will break users of the NFI that rely on native access (e.g. the GraalVM LLVM Runtime, unless used with --llvm.managed on EE).Native APIThe NFI can be used with unmodified, already compiled native code, but it can also be used with a Truffle-specific API being used by the native code.The special type ENV adds an additional parameter TruffleEnv *env to the signature.An additional simple type OBJECT translates to an opaque TruffleObject type.The trufflenfi.h header file provides declarations for working with these types, that can then be used by the native code called through the NFI.See trufflenfi.h for more documentation on this API.Type MarshallingThis section describes in detail how argument values and return values are converted for all types in the function signature.The following table shows the possible types in NFI signatures with their corresponding C language types on the native side, and what polyglot values these arguments map to on the managed side:            NFI type      C language type      Polyglot value                  VOID      void      Polyglot object with isNull == true (only valid as return type).              SINT8/16/32/64      int8/16/32/64_t      Polyglot isNumber that fitsIn... the corresponding integer type.              UINT8/16/32/64      uint8/16/32/64_t      Polyglot isNumber that fitsIn... the corresponding integer type.              FLOAT      float      Polyglot isNumber that fitsInFloat.              DOUBLE      double      Polyglot isNumber that fitsInDouble.              POINTER      void *      Polyglot object with isPointer == true or isNull == true.              STRING      char * (zero-terminated UTF-8 string)      Polyglot isString.              OBJECT      TruffleObject      Arbitrary object.              [type]      type * (array of primitive)      Java host primitive array.              (args):ret      ret (*)(args) (function pointer type)      Polyglot function with isExecutable == true.              ENV      TruffleEnv *      nothing (injected argument)      The following sections describe the type conversions in detail.The type conversion behavior with function pointers can be slightly confusing, because the direction of the arguments is reversed.When in doubt, always try to figure out in which direction arguments or return values flow, from managed to native or from native to managed.VOIDThis type is only allowed as return type, and is used to denote functions that do not return a value.Since in the Polyglot API, all executable objects have to return a value, a Polyglot object with isNull == true will be returned from native functions that have a VOID return type.The return value of managed callback functions with return type VOID will be ignored.Primitive NumbersThe primitive number types are converted as you might expect.The argument needs to be a Polyglot number, and its value needs to fit in the value range of the specified numeric type.One thing to note is the handling of the unsigned integer types.Even though the Polyglot API does not specify separate messages for values fitting in unsigned types, the conversion is still using the unsigned value ranges.For example, the value 0xFF passed from native to managed through a return value of type SINT8 will result in a Polyglot number -1, which fitsInByte.But the same value returned as UINT8 results in a Polyglot number 255, which does not fitsInByte.When passing numbers from managed code to native code, the signedness of the number is ignored, only the bits of the number are relevant.So for example, passing -1 to an argument of type UINT8 is allowed, and the result on the native side is 255, since it has the same bits as -1.The other way round, passing 255 to an argument of type SINT8 is also allowed, and the result on the native side is -1.Since in the current Polyglot API it is not possible to represent numbers outside of the signed 64-bit range, the UINT64 type is currently handled with signed semantics.This is a known bug in the API, and will change in a future release.POINTERThis type is a generic pointer argument.On the native side, it does not matter what exact pointer type the argument is.A polyglot object passed to POINTER arguments will be converted to a native pointer if possible (using the isPointer, asPointer and toNative messages as necessary).An object with isNull == true will be passed as a native NULL.POINTER return values will produce a polyglot object with isPointer == true.The native NULL pointer will additionally have isNull == true.STRINGThis is a pointer type with special conversion semantics for strings.Polyglot strings passed from managed to native using the STRING type will be converted to a zero-terminated UTF-8 encoded string.For STRING arguments, the pointer is owned by the caller, and is guaranteed to stay alive for the duration of the call only.The STRING values returned from managed function pointers to a native caller are also owned by the caller.They have to be freed with free after use.Polyglot pointer values or null values can also be passed to STRING arguments.The semantics is the same as for POINTER arguments.The user is responsible for ensuring that the pointer is a valid UTF-8 string.The STRING values passed from native functions to managed code behave like POINTER return values, but in addition they have isString == true.The user is responsible for the ownership of the pointer and it might be necessary to free the return value, depending on the semantics of the called native function.After freeing the returned pointer, the returned polyglot string is invalid and reading it results in undefined behavior.In that sense, the returned polyglot string is not a safe object, similar to a raw pointer.It is recommented that the user of the NFI copies the returned string before passing it along to untrusted managed code.OBJECTThis argument corresponds to the C type TruffleObject.This type is defined in trufflenfi.h, and is an opaque pointer type.A value of type TruffleObject represents a reference to an arbitrary managed object.Native code can do nothing with values of type TruffleObject except pass them back to managed code, either through return values or passing them to callback function pointers.The lifetime of TruffleObject references needs to be managed manually.See the documentation in trufflenfi.h for API functions to manage the lifetime of TruffleObject references.A TruffleObject passed as an argument is owned by the caller, and guaranteed to stay alive for the duration of the call.A TruffleObject reference returned from a callback function pointer is owned by the caller, and needs to be freed after use.Returning a TruffleObject from a native function does not transfer ownership (but there is an API function in trufflenfi.h to do that).[...] (Native Primitive Arrays)This type is only allowed as an argument from managed code to a native function, and only arrays of primitive numeric types are supported.On the managed side, only Java host objects containing a Java primitive array are supported.On the native side, the type is a pointer to the contents of the array.It is the user’s responsibility to pass along the array length as a separate argument.The pointer is valid for the duration of the native call only.Modifications to the contents are propagated back to the Java array after returning from the call.The effects of concurrent access to the Java array during the native call are unspecified.(...):... (Function Pointer)On the native side, a nested signature type corresponds to a function pointer with the given signature, calling back to managed code.Polyglot executable objects passed from managed to native using a function pointer type are converted to a function pointer that can be called by the native code.For function pointer arguments, the function pointer is owned by the caller, and is guaranteed to stay alive for the duration of the call only.Function pointer return values are owned by the caller, and have to be freed manually.See polyglot.h for API functions to manage the lifetime of function pointer values.Polyglot pointer values or null values can also be passed to function pointer arguments.The semantics is the same as for POINTER arguments.The user is responsible for ensuring that the pointer is a valid function pointer.Function pointer return types are the same as regular POINTER return types, but in addition they are already bound to the given signature type.They support the execute message, and behave the same as regular NFI functions.ENVThis type is a special argument of type TruffleEnv *.It is only valid as argument type, not as a return type.It is an injected argument on the native side, there is no corresponding argument on the managed side.When used as argument type of a native function, the native function will get an environment pointer on this position.That environment pointer can be used to call API functions (see trufflenfi.h).The argument is injected, for example, if the signature is (SINT32, ENV, SINT32):VOID.This function object is expected to be called with two integer arguments, and the corresponding native function will be called with three arguments: first the first real argument, then the injected ENV argument, and then the second real argument.When the ENV type is used as an argument type for a function pointer parameter, that function pointer must be called with a valid NFI environment as an argument.If the caller already has an environment, threading it through to callback function pointers is more efficient than calling them without an ENV argument.Calling ConventionNative functions must use the system’s standard ABI.There is currently no support for alternative ABIs.",

          "title": "Migration Guide from Nashorn to GraalVM JavaScript",
          "content": "Migration Guide from Nashorn to GraalVM JavaScriptThis guide serves as a migration guide for code previously targeted to the Nashorn engine.See the Java Interoperability guide for an overview of supported Java interoperability features.The Nashorn engine has been deprecated in JDK 11 as part of JEP 335 andand has been removed from JDK15 as part of JEP 372.GraalVM can step in as a replacement for JavaScript code previously executed on the Nashorn engine.GraalVM provides all the features for JavaScript previously provided by Nashorn.Many are available by default, some are behind flags, and others require minor modifications to your source code.Both Nashorn and GraalVM JavaScript support a similar set of syntax and semantics for Java interoperability.One notable difference is that GraalVM JavaScript takes a secure by default approach, meaning some features need to be explicitly enabled that were available by default on Nashorn.The most important differences relevant for migration are listed here.Nashorn features available by default (dependent on security settings):  Java.type, Java.typeName  Java.from, Java.to  Java.extend, Java.super  Java package globals: Packages, java, javafx, javax, com, org, eduNashorn Compatibility ModeGraalVM JavaScript provides a Nashorn compatibility mode.Some of the functionality necessary for Nashorn compatibility is only available when the js.nashorn-compat option is enabled.This is the case for Nashorn-specific extensions that GraalVM JavaScript does not want to expose by default.Note that you have to enable experimental options to use this flag.Further note that setting this flag defeats the secure by default approach of GraalVM JavaScript in some cases, e.g., when operating on a legacy ScriptEngine.When you use the Nashorn compatibility mode, by default, ECMAScript 5 is set as compatibility level.You can specify a different ECMAScript version using the js.ecmascript-version flag; note that this might conflict with full Nashorn compatibilty.A code example how to set the flag is given near the end of this section.The js.nashorn-compat option can be set:1. by using a command line option:js --experimental-options --js.nashorn-compat=true2. by using the Polyglot API:import org.graalvm.polyglot.Context;try (Context context = Context.newBuilder().allowExperimentalOptions(true).option(&quot;js.nashorn-compat&quot;, &quot;true&quot;).build()) {    context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;print(__LINE__)&quot;);}3. by using a system property when starting a Java application (remember to enable allowExperimentalOptions on the Context.Builder in your application as well):java -Dpolyglot.js.nashorn-compat=true MyApplicationFunctionality only available under the nashorn-compat flag includes:  Java.isJavaFunction, Java.isJavaMethod, Java.isScriptObject, Java.isScriptFunction  new Interface|AbstractClass(fn|obj)  JavaImporter  JSAdapter  java.lang.String methods on string values  load(&quot;nashorn:parser.js&quot;), load(&quot;nashorn:mozilla_compat.js&quot;)  exit, quitThe js.ecmascript-version option can be set in similar fashion.As this is a supported option, there is no need to provide the experimental-options flag just for setting the ecmascript-version:1. by using a command line option:js --js.ecmascript-version=2020Nashorn Syntax ExtensionsNashorn syntax extensions can be enabled using the js.syntax-extensions experimental option.They are also enabled by default in the Nashorn compatibility mode (js.nashorn-compat).GraalVM JavaScript vs NashornGraalVM JavaScript differs from Nashorn in some aspects that were intentional design decisions.Secure by DefaultGraalVM JavaScript takes a secure by default approach.Unless explicitly permitted by the embedder, JavaScript code cannot access Java classes or access the file system, among other restrictions.Several features of GraalVM JavaScript, including Nashorn compatibility features, are only available when the relevant security settings are permissive enough.Make sure you understand the security implications of any change that lifts the secure default limits to your application and the host system.For a full list of available settings, see Context.Builder.Those flags can be defined when building the context with GraalVM Polyglot API.Flags frequently required to enable features of GraalVM JavaScript are:  allowHostAccess(): configure which public constructors, methods or fields of public classes are accessible by guest applications. Use HostAccess.EXPLICIT or a custom HostAccess policy to selectively enable access. Set to HostAccess.ALL to allow unrestricted access.  allowHostClassLookup(): set a filter that specifies the Java host classes that can be looked up by the guest application. Set to the Predicate className -&amp;gt; true to allow lookup of all classes.  allowIO(): allow the guest language to perform unrestricted IO operations on the host system, required, e.g., to load() from the file system. Set to true to enable IO.If you run code on the legacy ScriptEngine, see Setting options via Bindings regarding how to set them there.Finally, note that the nashorn-compat mode enables the relevant flags when executing code on the ScriptEngine (but not on Context), to provide better compatibilty with Nashorn in that setup.Launcher Name jsGraalVM JavaScript comes with a binary launcher named js.Note that, depending on the build setup, GraalVM might still ship Nashorn and its jjs launcher.ScriptEngine Name graal.jsGraalVM JavaScript is shipped with support for ScriptEngine.It registers under several names, including “graal.js”, “JavaScript”, and “js”.Be sure to activate the Nashorn compatibility mode as described above if you need full Nashorn compatibility.Depending on the build setup, GraalVM might still ship Nashorn and provide it via ScriptEngine.For more details, see ScriptEngine Implementation.ClassFilterGraalVM JavaScript supports a class filter when starting with a polyglot Context.See Context.Builder.hostClassFilter.Fully Qualified NamesGraalVM Javascript requires the use of Java.type(typename).It does not support accessing classes just by their fully qualified class name by default.Java.type brings more clarity and avoids the accidental use of Java classes in JavaScript code.For instance, look at this pattern:var bd = new java.math.BigDecimal(&#39;10&#39;);It should be expressed as:var BigDecimal = Java.type(&#39;java.math.BigDecimal&#39;);var bd = new BigDecimal(&#39;10&#39;);Lossy ConversionGraalVM JavaScript does not allow lossy conversions of arguments when calling Java methods.This could lead to bugs with numeric values that are hard to detect.GraalVM JavaScript will always select the overloaded method with the narrowest possible argument types that can be converted to without loss.If no such overloaded method is available, GraalVM JavaScript throws a TypeError instead of lossy conversion.In general, this affects which overloaded method is executed.Custom targetTypeMappings can be used to customize behaviour. See HostAccess.Builder#targetTypeMapping.ScriptObjectMirror ObjectsGraalVM JavaScript does not provide objects of the class ScriptObjectMirror.Instead, JavaScript objects are exposed to Java code as objects implementing Java’s Map interface.Code referencing ScriptObjectMirror instances can be rewritten by changing the type to either an interface (Map or List) or the polyglot Value class which provides similar capabilities.MultithreadingRunning JavaScript on GraalVM supports multithreading by creating several Context objects from Java code.Contexts can be shared between threads, but each context must be accessed by a single thread at a time.Multiple JavaScript engines can be created from a Java application, and can be safely executed in parallel on multiple threads:Context polyglot = Context.create();Value array = polyglot.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;[1,2,42,4]&quot;);GraalVM JavaScript does not allow the creation of threads from JavaScript applications with access to the current Context.Moreover, GraalVM JavaScript does not allow concurrent threads to access the same Context at the same time.This could lead to unmanagable synchronization problems like data races in a language that is not prepared for multithreading. For example:new Thread(function() {    print(&#39;printed from another thread&#39;); // throws Exception due to potential synchronization problems}).start();JavaScript code can create and start threads with Runnables implemented in Java.The child thread may not access the Context of the parent thread or of any other polyglot thread.In case of violations, an IllegalStateException will be thrown.A child thread may create a new Context instance, though.new Thread(aJavaRunnable).start(); // allowed on GraalVM JavaScriptWith proper synchronization in place, multiple contexts can be shared between different threads. The example Java applications using GraalVM JavaScript Contexts from multiple threads can be found here.Extensions Only Available in Nashorn Compatibility ModeThe following extensions to JavaScript available in Nashorn are deactivated in GraalVM JavaScript by default.They are provided in GraalVM’s Nashorn compatibility mode.It is highly recommended not to implement new applications based on those features, but only to use it as a means to migrate existing applications to GraalVM.String length PropertyGraalVM JavaScript does not treat the length property of a String specially.The canonical way of accessing the String length is reading the length property:myJavaString.length;Nashorn allows users to access length as both a property and a function.Existing function calls length() should be expressed as property access.Nashorn behavior is mimicked in the Nashorn compatibility mode.Java Packages in the JavaScript Global ObjectGraalVM JavaScript requires the use of Java.type instead of fully qualified names.In the Nashorn compatibility mode, the following Java packages are added to the JavaScript global object: java, javafx, javax, com, org, and edu.JavaImporterThe JavaImporter feature is available only in the Nashorn compatibility mode.JSAdapterThe use of the non-standard JSAdapter feature is discouraged and should be replaced with the equivalent standard Proxy feature.For compatibility, JSAdapter is still available in the Nashorn compatibility mode.Java.* MethodsSeveral methods provided by Nashorn on the Java global object are available only in the Nashorn compatibility mode, or currently not supported by GraalVM JavaScript.Available in the Nashorn compatibility mode are: Java.isJavaFunction, Java.isJavaMethod, Java.isScriptObject, and Java.isScriptFunction. Java.asJSONCompatible is currently not supported.AccessorsIn the Nashorn compatibility mode, GraalVM JavaScript allows users to access getters and setters just by using the names as properties, while omitting get, set, or is:var Date = Java.type(&#39;java.util.Date&#39;);var date = new Date();var myYear = date.year; // calls date.getYear()date.year = myYear + 1; // calls date.setYear(myYear + 1);GraalVM JavaScript mimics the behavior of Nashorn regarding the ordering of the access:  In case of a read operation, GraalVM JavaScript will first try to call a getter with the name get and the property name in camel case. If that is not available, a getter with the name is and the property name in camel case is called. In the second case, unlike Nashorn, the resulting value is returned even if it is not of type boolean. Only if both methods are not available, the property itself will be read.  In case of a write operation, GraalVM JavaScript will try to call a setter with the name set and the property name in camel case, providing the value as argument to that function. If the setter is not available, the property itself will be written.Note that Nashorn (and thus, GraalVM JavaScript) makes a clear distinction between property read/writes and function calls.When the Java class has both a field and a method of the same name publicly available, obj.property will always read the field (or the getter as discussed above), while obj.property() will always call the respective method.Additional Aspects to ConsiderFeatures of GraalVM JavaScriptGraalVM JavaScript supports features of the newest ECMAScript specification and some extensions to it.See JavaScript Compatibility.Note that this example adds objects to the global scope that might interfere with existing source code unaware of those extensions.Console OutputGraalVM JavaScript provides a print builtin function compatible with Nashorn.Note that GraalVM JavaScript also provides a console.log function.This is an alias for print in pure JavaScript mode, but uses an implementation provided by Node.js when running in Node mode.The behaviour around Java objects differs for console.log in Node mode as Node.js does not implement special treatment for such objects.",

          "title": "Native Executables with Python",
          "content": "Native Executables with PythonGraalPy supports GraalVM Native Image to generate native binaries of Java applications that use GraalPy.QuickstartIf you started with the Maven archetype, the generated pom.xml makes it easy to generate a native executable using the Maven plugin for Native Image building.To build the application, run:mvn -Pnative packageThe command packages the project and creates a native executable.Take a look at the generated files pom.xml and Main.java.They are documented to explain how Python resources are included in the resulting binary.The generated project should be viewed as a starting point.It includes the entire Python standard library, so the Python code can invoke all of the standard library code.The resources can be manually pruned to reduce the included Python libraries to the necessary amount, reducing both the size of the package and the time to start up.This Java example demonstrates some useful default options for the Python context, but other settings may be desirable to further control what the Python code is allowed to do.Reducing Binary SizePython is a large language.“Batteries included” has long been a core tenet of CPython.As a compatible replacement, GraalPy includes most of those “batteries” as well.This can result in significant increases in binary size when including GraalPy in a Java application.Only you as the developer know your specific embedding scenario.The defaults may include much more than needed for any specific application.An embedded Python-in-Java application usually has more limited use cases for the Python interpreter than the full GraalPy distribution, and often you can know ahead of time whether certain features are needed.Some features (for example, cryptographic algorithms or socket access) may even be undesirable to include in some cases.Thus, when embedding GraalPy in a Java application, the binary size can be reduced and security improved by excluding components of the Python language.Excluding Python ComponentsGraalPy defines a few system properties that can be passed on the native-image command line to exclude aspects of the language.The options can, when taken together, reduce the size of the executable by around 20%.These are:  python.WithoutSSL=true - This option removes the ssl module.If no secure network access or certificate checking is required, this removes Java’s SSL classes and the BouncyCastle library.  python.WithoutDigest=true - This option removes the _md5, _sha1, _sha256, _sha512, _sha3, and _hashlib modules.This removes the direct usages of java.security.MessageDigest and javax.crypto.Mac from GraalPy.  python.WithoutPlatformAccess=true - This removes the signal and subprocess modules, removes accesses to process properties such as the Unix UID and GID, or setting the Java default time zone.This has no significant impact on binary size, but if these are unwanted capabilities that are dynamically disabled with context options anyway, they can also be removed ahead of time.  python.WithoutCompressionLibraries=true - This removes the zlib, lzma, bzip2, and zipimporter modules and related classes.These modules have both native and pure Java implementations (the former for performance, the latter for better sandboxing); however, if they are not needed, they can be removed entirely.  python.WithoutNativePosix=true - The default os module backend is a pure Java implementation when GraalPy is embedded rather than run via its launcher.The native POSIX backend of GraalPy is recommended only for 100% compatibility with CPython’s POSIX interfaces, and if not used, can be removed from the build with this option.  python.WithoutJavaInet=true - The Java implementation of Python’s socket module is based on Java’s networking classes.If network access is denied for an embedding scenario, this option can reduce the binary size further.  python.AutomaticAsyncActions=false - Signal handling, Python weak reference callbacks, and cleaning up native resources is usually achieved automatically by spawning GraalPy daemon threads that submit safepoint actions to the Python main thread.This uses an ExecutorService with a thread pool.If you want to disallow such extra threads or avoid pulling in ExecutorService and related classes, then set this property to false and retrieve the PollPythonAsyncActions object from the context’s polyglot bindings.This object is executable and can be used to trigger Python asynchronous actions at the locations you desire.  python.WithoutJNI=true - This option removes any code that uses JNI. As a consequence, you cannot use the HPy JNI backend and maybe other parts that rely on JNI.Removing Pre-initialized Python HeapAnother useful option to reduce the size of the native executable is to omit a pre-initialized Python context from the executable.By default, a default Python context is already pre-initialized and ready for immediate execution.This can lead to slightly improved startup, at the cost of including a few thousand Python objects in the binary.In embedded applications that use a custom polyglot engine to allow context sharing, the pre-initialized context cannot be used at all, and including those objects is wasted.The pre-initialized heap can be omitted by passing the following to the native-image command:-Dimage-build-time.PreinitializeContexts=Disabling Runtime Compilation of Python CodeIf binary size is significantly more important than execution speed (which may be the case if all Python scripts are expected to be short running, perform a lot of I/O, or scripts are rarely executed more than once), it may make sense to disable JIT compilation entirely.Be aware that this may significantly impact your Python performance, so be sure to test the runtime behavior of your actual use cases when choosing to use this option.This can be achieved by passing the following options:-Dtruffle.TruffleRuntime=com.oracle.truffle.api.impl.DefaultTruffleRuntime -Dpolyglot.engine.WarnInterpreterOnly=falseSummaryCombining all of these approaches can halve the size of the GraalPy binary.Every embedded application is different and the code pulled in by the rest of the Java code also matters, so combinations of these options should be tried to determine which effect they have in a specific instance.Shipping Python PackagesOur Maven archetype by default is set up to include all needed Python files in the native binary itself, so the image is self-contained.In custom embeddings, the Python standard library is copied next to the native image.When moving the native image, the standard library folder needs to be kept next to it.",

          "title": "Interaction of GraalVM with Native Code",
          "content": "Interaction of GraalVM with Native CodeThe GraalVM LLVM runtime allows users to run code written in languages that traditionally compile directly to native code.These languages typically do not require any managed runtime or VM to run.Therefore, special care is needed to consider the interaction of this code with the managed runtime of GraalVM, in particular if the code is using certain low-level features.Limited Access to Low-level System Calls  Signal handling is performed based on the following assumptions:          The managed runtime assumes that it has full control of handling all signals.      Installed signal handlers might behave differently than on native execution.        Process control and threading is done based on the following aspects:          GraalVM assumes it has full control over threading.      Multi-threading is supported via the pthreads library (for example, pthread_create).      Directly using process related syscalls like clone, fork, vfork, etc. is not supported.      The exec function family is not supported.      Memory LayoutThe memory and stack layout of processes running on GraalVM is different than with direct native execution.In particular, no assumptions are possible about the relative positions of globals, stack variables and so on.Walking the stack is only possible using the GraalVM APIs.There is a strict separation between code and data.Self-modifying code will not work.Reads, writes and pointer arithmetic on pointers to code are not supported.Interaction with System Libraries in Native ModeIn the native execution mode (the default mode), code running on the GraalVM LLVM runtime can do calls to real native libraries (for example, system libraries).These calls behave similar to JNI calls in Java: they temporarily leave the managed execution environment.Since the code executed in these libraries is not under the control of GraalVM, that code can essentially do anything.In particular, no multicontext isolation applies, and GraalVM APIs like the virtual filesystem are bypassed.Note that this applies in particular to most of the standard C library.Managed Execution ModeThe managed mode (enabled with the --llvm.managed option) is a special execution mode where the LLVM runtime runs purely in managed mode, similar to all other GraalVM supported languages.  Note: The managed mode is only available in Oracle GraalVM.In this mode, by design, it is not allowed to call native code and access native memory.All memory is managed by the garbage collector, and all code that should be run needs to be compiled to bitcode.Pointer arithmetic is only possible to the extent allowed by the C standard.In particular, overflows are prevented, and it is not possible to access different allocations via out-of-bounds access.All such invalid accesses result in runtime exceptions rather than in undefined behavior.In managed mode, GraalVM simulates a virtual Linux/AMD64 operating system, with musl libc and libc++ as the C/C++ standard libraries.All code needs to be compiled for that system, and can then be used to run on any architecture or operating system supported by GraalVM.Syscalls are virtualized and routed through appropriate GraalVM APIs.Polyglot Interaction Between Native Code and Managed LanguagesWhen using polyglot interoperability between LLVM languages (e.g., C/C++) and managed languages (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Ruby), some care must be taken with the manual memory management.Note that this section only applies to the native mode of execution (the default).In managed mode (enabled with the --llvm.managed option and only available in Oracle GraalVM), the LLVM runtime itself behaves like a managed language, and the polyglot interaction is the same as between other managed languages.  Garbage collection policies to be considered:          Pointers to objects of managed languages are managed by a garbage collector, therefore they do not need to be freed manually.      On the other hand, pointers to allocations from the LLVM code (e.g., malloc) are not under control of the garbage collector, so they need to be deallocated manually.        Unmanaged heap policies to be considered:          Native memory (e.g., malloc, data sections, thread locals) is not under the control of a garbage collector.      Pointers to foreign objects controlled by the garbage collector can not be stored in native memory directly.      There are handle functions available to work around this limitation (see graalvm/llvm/handles.h).      ",

          "content": "Native Image BasicsNative Image is written in Java and takes Java bytecode as input to produce a standalone binary (an executable, or a shared library).During the process of producing a binary, Native Image can run user code.Finally, Native Image links compiled user code, parts of the Java runtime (for example, the garbage collector, threading support), and the results of code execution into the binary.We refer to this binary as a native executable, or a native image.We refer to the utility that produces the binary as the native-image builder, or the native-image generator.To clearly distinguish between code executed during the native image build, and code executed during the native image execution, we refer to the difference between the two as build time and run time.To produce a minimal image, Native Image employs a process called static analysis.Table of Contents  Build Time vs Run Time  Native Image Heap  Static AnalysisBuild Time vs Run TimeDuring the image build, Native Image may execute user code.This code can have side effects, such as writing a value to a static field of a class.We say that this code is executed at build time.Values written to static fields by this code are saved in the image heap.Run time refers to code and state in the binary when it is executed.The easiest way to see the difference between these two concepts is through configurable class initialization.In Java, a class is initialized when it is first used.Every Java class used at build time is said to be build-time initialized.Note that merely loading a class does not necessarily initialize it.The static class initializer of build-time initialized classes executes on the JVM running the image build.If a class is initialized at build time, its static fields are saved in the produced binary.At run time, using such a class for the first time does not trigger class initialization.Users can trigger class initialization at build time in different ways:  By passing --initialize-at-build-time=&amp;lt;class&amp;gt; to the native-image builder.  By using a class in the static initializer of a build-time initialized class.Native Image will initialize frequently used JDK classes at image build time, for example, java.lang.String, java.util.**, etc.Note that build-time class initialization is an expert feature.Not all classes are suitable for build-time initialization.The following example demonstrates the difference between build-time and run-time executed code:public class HelloWorld {    static class Greeter {        static {            System.out.println(&quot;Greeter is getting ready!&quot;);        }                public static void greet() {          System.out.println(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);        }    }  public static void main(String[] args) {    Greeter.greet();  }}Having saved the code in a file named HelloWorld.java, we compile and run the application on the JVM:javac HelloWorld.javajava HelloWorld Greeter is getting ready!Hello, World!Now we build a native image of it, and then execute:native-image HelloWorld========================================================================================================================GraalVM Native Image: Generating &#39;helloworld&#39; (executable)...========================================================================================================================...Finished generating &#39;helloworld&#39; in 14.9s../helloworld Greeter is getting ready!Hello, World!HelloWorld started up and invoked Greeter.greet.

Object constants embedded in method code.When native image starts up, it copies the initial image heap from the binary.One way to include objects in the image heap is to initialize classes at build time:class Example {    private static final String message;        static {        message = System.getProperty(&quot;message&quot;);    }    public static void main(String[] args) {        System.out.println(&quot;Hello, World!

My message is: nativeThe class initializer of the Example class was executed at image build time.This created a String object for the message field and stored it inside the image heap.Static AnalysisStatic analysis is a process that determines which program elements (classes, methods and fields) are used by an application.These elements are also referred to as reachable code.The analysis itself has two parts:  Scanning the bytecodes of a method to determine what other elements are reachable from it.  Scanning the root objects in the native image heap (i.e., static fields) to determine which classes are reachable from them.It starts from the entry points of the application (i.e., the main method).The newly discovered elements are iteratively scanned until further scanning yields no additional changes in element’s reachability.Only reachable elements are included in the final image.Once a native image is built, no new elements can be added at run time, for example, through class loading.We refer to this constraint as the closed-world assumption.Further Reading  Native Image Build Overview  Class Initialization in Native Image",

          "content": "Differences Between Node.js and Java EmbeddingsGraalVM provides a fully-compliant ECMAScript 2023 JavaScript language runtime.As such, it can run JavaScript code in a variety of embedding scenarios, including Oracle Database, any Java-based application, and Node.js.Depending on the GraalVM’s JavaScript embedding scenario, applications have access to different built-in capabilities.For example, Node.js applications executed using GraalVM’s bin/node executable have access to all of Node.js’ APIs, including built-in Node.js modules such as fs, http, etc.Conversely, JavaScript code embedded in a Java application has access to limited capabilities, as specified through the Context API, and do not have access to Node.js built-in modules.This guide describes the main differences between a Node.js application and a GraalVM JavaScript application embedded in Java.Context CreationJavaScript code in GraalVM can be executed using a GraalVM execution Context.In a Java application, a new context can be created using the Context API.New contexts can be configured in multiple ways, and configuration options include exposing access to Java classes, allowing access to IO, etc.A list of context creation options can be found in the API documentation.In this scenario, Java classes can be exposed to JavaScript by using GraalVM’s polyglot Bindings.In a Node.js application, the GraalVM Context executing the application is pre-initialized by the Node.js runtime, and cannot be configured by the user application.In this scenario, Java classes can be exposed to the Node.js application by using the --vm.cp= command line option of the bin/node command, as described below.Java InteroperabilityJavaScript applications can interact with Java classes using the Java built-in object.This object is available by default in the js and node launchers, but accessing Java classes is only possible in the JVM standalones (that have -jvm in the name).When embedding GraalVM JavaScript using the Polyglot API, you have to explicitly enable host access in the Context.Builder (allowHostAccess, allowHostClassLookup).More details on the Java interoperability capabilities of GraalVM JavaScript are available in Java Interoperability.MultithreadingA GraalVM context running JavaScript enforces a “share-nothing” model of parallelism: no JavaScript values can be accessed by two concurrent Java threads at the same time.In order to leverage parallel execution, multiple contexts have to be created and executed from multiple threads:  In Node.js mode, multiple contexts can be created using Node.js’ Worker threads API.The Worker threads API ensures that no sharing can happen between two parallel contexts.  In Java, multiple contexts can be executed from multiple threads.As long as a context is not accessed by two threads at the same time, parallel execution happens safely.More details on parallel execution in GraalVM JavaScript are available in this blog post.Java LibrariesJava libraries can be accessed from JavaScript in GraalVM through the Java built-in object.In order for a Java library to be accessible from a Context, its jar files need to be added to the GraalVM classpath. This can be done in the following way:  In Node.js mode, the classpath can be modified using the --vm.cp option.  In Java, the default Java’s -cp option can be used.More details on GraalVM command line options are available in Options.JavaScript Packages and ModulesMany popular JavaScript modules such as those available on the npm package registry can be used from Node.js as well as from Java:  In Node.js mode, JavaScript modules are handled by the Node.js runtime.Therefore, GraalVM JavaScript supports all modules supported by Node.js (including ES modules, CommonJS modules, and native modules).  In Java mode, GraalVM JavaScript can execute any JavaScript module or package that does not depend on native Node.js built-in modules (such as &#39;fs&#39;, &#39;http&#39;, etc.)Modules can be loaded using a package bundler, or using the available built-in mechanisms for ES modules.CommonJS modules are supported in Java mode under an experimental flag.More details on JavaScript modules are available in Modules.",

          "content": "On-Stack Replacement (OSR)During execution, Truffle will schedule “hot” call targets for compilation.Once a target is compiled, later invocations of the target can execute the compiled version.However, an ongoing execution of a call target will not benefit from this compilation, since it cannot transfer execution to the compiled code.This means that a long-running target can get “stuck” in the interpreter, harming warmup performance.On-stack replacement (OSR) is a technique used in Truffle to “break out” of the interpreter, transferring execution from interpreted to compiled code.Truffle supports OSR for both AST interpreters (i.e., ASTs with LoopNodes) and bytecode interpreters (i.e., nodes with dispatch loops).In either case, Truffle uses heuristics to detect when a long-running loop is being interpreted and can perform OSR to speed up execution.OSR for AST interpretersLanguages using standard Truffle APIs get OSR for free on Graal.The runtime tracks the number of times a LoopNode (created using TruffleRuntime.createLoopNode(RepeatingNode)) executes in the interpreter.Once the loop iterations exceed a threshold, the runtime considers the loop “hot”, and it will transparently compile the loop, poll for completion, and then call the compiled OSR target.The OSR target uses the same Frame used by the interpreter.When the loop exits in the OSR execution, it returns to the interpreted execution, which forwards the result.See the LoopNode javadoc for more details.OSR for bytecode interpretersOSR for bytecode interpreters requires slightly more cooperation from the language.A bytecode dispatch node typically looks something like the following:class BytecodeDispatchNode extends Node {  @CompilationFinal byte[] bytecode;  ...  @ExplodeLoop(kind = ExplodeLoop.LoopExplosionKind.MERGE_EXPLODE)  Object execute(VirtualFrame frame) {    int bci = 0;    while (true) {      int nextBCI;      switch (bytecode[bci]) {        case OP1:          ...          nextBCI = ...          ...        case OP2:          ...          nextBCI = ...          ...        ...      }      bci = nextBCI;    }  }}Unlike with AST interpreters, loops in a bytecode interpreter are often unstructured (and implicit).Though bytecode languages do not have structured loops, backward jumps in the code (“back-edges”) tend to be a good proxy for loop iterations.Thus, Truffle’s bytecode OSR is designed around back-edges and the destination of those edges (which often correspond to loop headers).To make use of Truffle’s bytecode OSR, a language’s dispatch node should implement the BytecodeOSRNode interface.This interface requires (at minimum) three method implementations:  executeOSR(osrFrame, target, interpreterState): This method dispatches execution to the given target (i.e., bytecode index) using osrFrame as the current program state. The interpreterState object can pass any additional interpreter state needed to resume execution.  getOSRMetadata() and setOSRMetadata(osrMetadata): These methods proxy accesses to a field declared on the class. The runtime will use these accessors to maintain state related to OSR compilation (e.g., back-edge counts). The field should be annotated @CompilationFinal.In the main dispatch loop, when the language hits a back-edge, it should invoke the provided BytecodeOSRNode.pollOSRBackEdge(osrNode) method to notify the runtime of the back-edge.If the runtime deems the node eligible for OSR compilation, this method returns true.If (and only if) pollOSRBackEdge returns true, the language can call BytecodeOSRNode.tryOSR(osrNode, target, interpreterState, beforeTransfer, parentFrame) to attempt OSR.This method will request compilation starting from target, and once compiled code is available, a subsequent call can transparently invoke the compiled code and return the computed result.We will discuss the interpreterState and beforeTransfer parameters shortly.The example above can be refactored to support OSR as follows:class BytecodeDispatchNode extends Node implements BytecodeOSRNode {  @CompilationFinal byte[] bytecode;  @CompilationFinal private Object osrMetadata;  ...  Object execute(VirtualFrame frame) {    return executeFromBCI(frame, 0);  }  Object executeOSR(VirtualFrame osrFrame, int target, Object interpreterState) {    return executeFromBCI(osrFrame, target);  }  Object getOSRMetadata() {    return osrMetadata;  }  void setOSRMetadata(Object osrMetadata) {    this.osrMetadata = osrMetadata;  }  @ExplodeLoop(kind = ExplodeLoop.LoopExplosionKind.MERGE_EXPLODE)  Object executeFromBCI(VirtualFrame frame, int bci) {    while (true) {      int nextBCI;      switch (bytecode[bci]) {        case OP1:          ...          nextBCI = ...          ...        case OP2:          ...          nextBCI = ...          ...        ...      }      if (nextBCI &amp;lt; bci) { // back-edge        if (BytecodeOSRNode.pollOSRBackEdge(this)) { // OSR can be tried          Object result = BytecodeOSRNode.tryOSR(this, nextBCI, null, null, frame);          if (result != null) { // OSR was performed            return result;          }        }      }      bci = nextBCI;    }  }}A subtle difference with bytecode OSR is that the OSR execution continues past the end of the loop until the end of the call target.Thus, execution does not need to continue in the interpreter once execution returns from OSR; the result can simply be forwarded to the caller.The interpreterState parameter to tryOSR can contain any additional interpreter state required for execution.This state is passed to executeOSR and can be used to resume execution.For example, if an interpreter uses a data pointer to manage reads/writes, and it is unique for each target, this pointer can be passed in interpreterState.It will be visible to the compiler and used in partial evaluation.The beforeTransfer parameter to tryOSR is an optional callback which will be invoked before performing OSR.Since tryOSR may or may not perform OSR, this parameter is a way to perform any actions before transferring to OSR code.For example, a language may pass a callback to send an instrumentation event before jumping to OSR code.The BytecodeOSRNode interface also contains a few hook methods whose default implementations can be overridden:  copyIntoOSRFrame(osrFrame, parentFrame, target) and restoreParentFrame(osrFrame, parentFrame): Reusing the interpreted Frame inside OSR code is not optimal, because it escapes the OSR call target and prevents scalar replacement (for background on scalar replacement, see this paper).When possible, Truffle will use copyIntoOSRFrame to copy the interpreted state (parentFrame) into the OSR Frame (osrFrame), and restoreParentFrame to copy state back into the parent Frame afterwards.By default, both hooks copy each slot between the source and destination frames, but this can be overridden for finer control (e.g., to only copy over live variables).If overridden, these methods should be written carefully to support scalar replacement.  prepareOSR(target): This hook gets called before compiling an OSR target.It can be used to force any initialization to happen before compilation.For example, if a field can only be initialized in the interpreter, prepareOSR can ensure it is initialized, so that OSR code does not deoptimize when trying to access it.Bytecode-based OSR can be tricky to implement. Some debugging tips:  Ensure that the metadata field is marked @CompilationFinal.  If a Frame with a given FrameDescriptor has been materialized before, Truffle will reuse the interpreter Frame instead of copying (if copying is used, any existing materialized Frame could get out of sync with the OSR Frame).  It is helpful to trace compilation and deoptimization logs to identify any initialization work which could be done in prepareOSR.  Inspecting the compiled OSR targets in IGV can be useful to ensure the copying hooks interact well with partial evaluation.See the BytecodeOSRNode javadoc for more details.Command-line optionsThere are two (experimental) options which can be used to configure OSR:  engine.OSR: whether to perform OSR (default: true)  engine.OSRCompilationThreshold: the number of loop iterations/back-edges required to trigger OSR compilation (default: 100,352).DebuggingOSR compilation targets are marked with &amp;lt;OSR&amp;gt; (or &amp;lt;OSR@n&amp;gt; where n is the dispatch target, in the case of bytecode OSR).These targets can be seen and debugged using standard debugging tools like the compilation log and IGV.For example, in the compilation log, a bytecode OSR entry may look something like:[engine] opt done     BytecodeNode@2d3ca632&amp;lt;OSR@42&amp;gt;                               |AST    2|Tier 1|Time   21(  14+8   )ms|Inlined   0Y   0N|IR   161/  344|CodeSize   1234|Addr 0x7f3851f45c10|Src n/aSee Debugging for more details on debugging Graal compilations.",

          "content": "JVM Operations ManualRunning the Graal compiler in Native Image vs on the JVMWhen running the Graal compiler on the JVM, it goes through the same warm-up phase that the rest of the Java application does.That is, it is first interpreted before its hot methods are compiled.This can translate into slightly longer times until the application reaches peak performance when compared to the native compilers in the JVM such as C1 and C2.To address the issue of taking longer to reach to peak performance, libgraal was introduced – a shared library, produced using Native Image to ahead-of-time compile the compiler itself.That means the Oracle GraalVM compiler is deployed as a native shared library.In this mode, the compiler uses memory separate from the HotSpot heap, and it runs compiled from the start.Therefore it has execution properties similar to other native HotSpot compilers such as C1 and C2.Currently, this is the default mode of operation.It can be disabled with -XX:-UseJVMCINativeLibrary.Measuring PerformanceThe first thing to be sure of when measuring performance is to ensure the JVM is using the Oracle GraalVM compiler.In the GraalVM binary, the JVM is configured to use the Graal compiler as the top tier compiler by default.You can confirm this by adding -Djdk.graal.ShowConfiguration=info to the command line.It will produce a line of output similar to the one below when the compiler is initialized:Using &quot;Graal Community compiler&quot; loaded from class files  Note: The Graal compiler is only initialized on the first top-tier JIT compilation request so if your application is short-lived, you may not see this output.Optimizing JVM-based applications is a science in itself.The compilation may not even be a factor in the case of poor performance as the problem may lie in any other part of the VM (I/O, garbage collection, threading, etc), or ina poorly written application or 3rd party library code. For this reason, it is  worth utilizing the JDK Mission Control tool chain to diagnose the application behavior.You can also compare performance against the native top-tier compiler in the JVM by adding -XX:-UseJVMCICompiler to the command line.If you observe a significant performance regression when using the Graal compiler, please open an issue on GitHub.Attaching a Java Flight Recorder log and instructions to reproduce the issue makes investigation easier and thus the chances of a fix higher.Even better is if you can submit a JMH benchmark that represents the hottest parts of your application (as identified by a profiler).This allows us to very quickly pinpoint missing optimization opportunities or to offer suggestions on how to restructure the code to avoid or reduce performance bottlenecks.Troubleshooting the Graal compilerLike all software, the Graal compiler is not guaranteed to be bug free so it is useful to know how to diagnose and submit useful bug reports if you encounter issues.If you spot a security vulnerability, please do not report it via GitHub Issues or the public mailing lists, but via the process outlined at Reporting Vulnerabilities guide.Compilation ExceptionsOne advantage of the compiler being written in Java is that runtime exceptions during compilation are not fatal VM errors.Instead, each compilation has an exception handler that takes action based on the graal.CompilationFailureAction property.The default value is Silent. Specifying Diagnose causes failing compilations to be retried with extra diagnostics enabled.In this case, just before the VM exits, all diagnostic output captured during retried compilations is written to a .zip file and its location is printed on the console:Graal diagnostic output saved in /Users/demo/graal-dumps/1499768882600/graal_diagnostics_64565.zipYou can then attach the .zip file to an issue on GitHub.Apart from Silent and Diagnose, the following values for graal.CompilationFailureActionare also supported:  Print: prints a message and stack trace to the console but does not perform the re-compilation.  ExitVM: same as Diagnose but the VM process exits after the re-compilation.Code Generation ErrorsThe other type of error you might encounter with compilers is the production of incorrect machine code.This error can cause a VM crash, which should produce a file that starts with hs_err_pid in the current working directory of the VM process.In most cases, there is a section in the file that shows the stack at the time of the crash, including the type of code for each frame in the stack, as in the following example:Stack: [0x00007000020b1000,0x00007000021b1000],  sp=0x00007000021af7a0,  free space=1017kNative frames: (J=compiled Java code, j=interpreted, Vv=VM code, C=native code)J 761 JVMCI jdk.graal.compiler.core.gen.NodeLIRBuilder.matchComplexExpressions(Ljava/util/List;)V (299 bytes) @ 0x0000000108a2fc01 [0x0000000108a2fac0+0x141] (null)j  jdk.graal.compiler.core.gen.NodeLIRBuilder.doBlock(Ljdk.graal.compiler/nodes/cfg/Block;Ljdk.graal.compiler/nodes/StructuredGraph;Ljdk.graal.compiler/core/common/cfg/BlockMap;)V+211j  jdk.graal.compiler.core.LIRGenerationPhase.emitBlock(Ljdk.graal.compiler/nodes/spi/NodeLIRBuilderTool;Ljdk.graal.compiler/lir/gen/LIRGenerationResult;Ljdk.graal.compiler/nodes/cfg/Block;Ljdk.graal.compiler/nodes/StructuredGraph;Ljdk.graal.compiler/core/common/cfg/BlockMap;)V+65This example shows that the top frame was compiled (J) by the JVMCI compiler, which is the Graal compiler.The crash occurred at offset 0x141 in the machine code produced for:jdk.graal.compiler.core.gen.NodeLIRBuilder.matchComplexExpressions(Ljava/util/List;)VThe next two frames in the stack were executed in the interpreter (j).The location of the crash is also often indicated near the top of the file with something like this:# Problematic frame:# J 761 JVMCI jdk.graal.compiler.core.gen.NodeLIRBuilder.matchComplexExpressions(Ljava/util/List;)V (299 bytes) @ 0x0000000108a2fc01 [0x0000000108a2fac0+0x141] (null)In this example, there is likely an error in the code produced by the Graal compiler for NodeLIRBuilder.matchComplexExpressions.When filing an issue on GitHub for such a crash, you should first attempt to reproduce the crash with extra diagnostics enabled for the compilation of the problematic method.In this example, you would add the following to your command line:-Djdk.graal.MethodFilter=NodeLIRBuilder.matchComplexExpressions, -Djdk.graal.Dump=:2These options are described in more detail here.In brief, these options tell the compiler to capture snapshots of the compiler state at verbosity level 2 while compiling any method named matchComplexExpressions in a class with a simple name of NodeLIRBuilder.The complete format of the MethodFilter option is described in the output of java -XX:+JVMCIPrintProperties.Quite often, the crash location does not exist directly in the problematic method mentioned in the crash log but comes from an inlined method.In such a case, simply filtering for the problematic method might not capture an erroneous compilation causing a crash.To improve the likelihood of capturing an erroneous compilation, you need to broaden the MethodFilter value.To guide this, add -Djdk.graal.PrintCompilation=true when trying to reproduce the crash so you can see what was compiled just before the crash.The following shows sample output from the console:HotSpotCompilation-1218        Ljdk.graal.compiler/core/amd64/AMD64NodeLIRBuilder;                  peephole                                      (Ljdk.graal.compiler/nodes/ValueNode;)Z           |   87ms   428B   447B  1834kBHotSpotCompilation-1212        Ljdk.graal.compiler/lir/LIRInstructionClass;                         forEachState                                  (Ljdk.graal.compiler/lir/LIRInstruction;Ljdk.graal.compiler/lir/InstructionValueProcedure;)V  |  359ms    92B   309B  6609kBHotSpotCompilation-1221        Ljdk.graal.compiler/hotspot/amd64/AMD64HotSpotLIRGenerator;          getResult                                     ()Ljdk.graal.compiler/hotspot/HotSpotLIRGenerationResult;  |   54ms    18B   142B  1025kB## A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:##  SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x000000010a6cafb1, pid=89745, tid=0x0000000000004b03## JRE version: OpenJDK Runtime Environment (8.0_121-b13) (build 1.8.0_121-graalvm-olabs-b13)# Java VM: OpenJDK 64-Bit GraalVM (25.71-b01-internal-jvmci-0.30 mixed mode bsd-amd64 compressed oops)# Problematic frame:# J 1221 JVMCI jdk.graal.compiler.hotspot.amd64.AMD64HotSpotLIRGenerator.getResult()Ljdk.graal.compiler/hotspot/HotSpotLIRGenerationResult; (18 bytes) @ 0x000000010a6cafb1 [0x000000010a6caf60+0x51] (null)## Failed to write core dump.

          "title": "Operator Overloading",
          "content": "Operator OverloadingGraalVM JavaScript provides an early implementation of the ECMAScript operator overloading proposal.This lets you overload the behavior of JavaScript’s operators on your JavaScript classes.If you want to experiment with this feature, you will first need to enable it.Since both the proposal and our implementation of it are in early stages, you will need to set the following experimental option.js --experimental-options --js.operator-overloadingAfter setting the option, you will see a new builtin in the global namespace, the Operators function.You can call this function, passing it a JavaScript object as an argument.The object should have a property for every operator you wish to overload, with the key being the name of the operator and the value being a function which implements it.The return value of the Operators function is a constructor that you can then subclass when defining your type.By subclassing this constructor, you get a class whose objects will all inherit the overloaded operator behavior that you defined in your argument to the Operators function.Basic ExampleLet’s look at an example from the original proposal featuring vectors:const VectorOps = Operators({  &quot;+&quot;(a, b) {    return new Vector(a.contents.map((elt, i) =&amp;gt; elt + b.contents[i]));  },  &quot;==&quot;(a, b) {    return a.contents.length === b.contents.length &amp;amp;&amp;amp;           a.contents.every((elt, i) =&amp;gt; elt == b.contents[i]);  },});class Vector extends VectorOps {  contents;  constructor(contents) {    super();    this.contents = contents;  }}Here we define overloads for two operators, + and ==.Calling the Operators function with the table of overloaded operators yields the VectorOps class.We then define our Vector class as a subclass of VectorOps.If we create instances of Vector, we can observe that they follow our overloaded operator definitions:&amp;gt; new Vector([1, 2, 3]) + new Vector([4, 5, 6]) == new Vector([5, 7, 9])trueExample with Mixed TypesIt is also possible to overload operators between values of different types, allowing, for example, multiplication of vectors by numbers.const VectorOps = Operators({    &quot;+&quot;(a, b) {        return new Vector(a.contents.map((elt, i) =&amp;gt; elt + b.contents[i]));    },    &quot;==&quot;(a, b) {        return a.contents.length === b.contents.length &amp;amp;&amp;amp;            a.contents.every((elt, i) =&amp;gt; elt == b.contents[i]);    },}, {    left: Number,    &quot;*&quot;(a, b) {        return new Vector(b.contents.map(elt =&amp;gt; elt * a));    }});class Vector extends VectorOps {    contents;    constructor(contents) {        super();        this.contents = contents;    }}To define mixed-type operators, we need to pass additional objects to the Operators function.These extra tables should each have either a left property or a right property, depending on whether we are overloading the behavior of operators with some other type on the left or on the right side of the operator.In our case, we are overloading the * operator for cases when there is a Number on the left and our type, Vector, on the right.Each extra table can have either a left property or a right property and then any number of operator overloads which will apply to that particular case.Let’s see this in action:&amp;gt; 2 * new Vector([1, 2, 3]) == new Vector([2, 4, 6])trueReferenceThe function Operators(table, extraTables...) returns a class with overloaded operators.Users should define their own class which extends that class.The table argument must be an object with one property for every overloaded operator.The property key must be the name of the operator.These are the names of operators which can be overloaded:  binary operators: &quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;%&quot;, &quot;**&quot;, &quot;&amp;amp;&quot;, &quot;^&quot;, &quot;|&quot;, &quot;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&quot;, &quot;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&quot;, &quot;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&quot;, &quot;==&quot;, &quot;&amp;lt;&quot;  unary operators: &quot;pos&quot;, &quot;neg&quot;, &quot;++&quot;, &quot;--&quot;, &quot;~&quot;The &quot;pos&quot; and &quot;neg&quot; operator names correspond to unary + and unary -, respectively.Overloading &quot;++&quot; works both for pre-increments ++x and post-increments x++, the same goes for &quot;--&quot;.The overload for &quot;==&quot; is used both for equality x == y and inequality x != y tests.Similarly, the overload for &quot;&amp;lt;&quot; is used for all comparison operators (x &amp;lt; y, x &amp;lt;= y, x &amp;gt; y, x &amp;gt;= y) by swapping the arguments and/or negating the result.The value assigned to an operator name must be a function of two arguments in the case of binary operators or a function of one argument in the case of unary operators.The table argument can also have an open property.If so, the value of that property must be an array of operator names.These are the operators which future classes will be able to overload on this type (e.g. a Vector type might declare &quot;*&quot; to be open so that later a Matrix type might overload the operations Vector * Matrix and Matrix * Vector).If the open property is missing, all operators are considered to be open for future overloading with other types.Following the first argument table are optional arguments extraTables.Each of these must also be an object.Each extra table must have either a left property or a right property, not both.The value of that property must be one of the following JavaScript constructors:  Number  BigInt  String  any class with overloaded operators (i.e. extended from a constructor returned by Operators)The other properties of the extra table should be operator overloads as in the first table argument (operator name as key, function implementing the operator as value).These extra tables define the behavior of operators when one of the operand types is of a type other than the one being defined.If the extra table has a left property, its operator definitions will apply to cases when the left operand is of the type named by the left property and the right operand is of the type whose operators are being defined.Similarly for the right property, if the extra table has a right property, the table’s operator definitions will apply when the right operand has the named type and the left operand has the type whose operators are being defined.Note that you are free to overload any of the binary operators between your custom type and the JavaScript numeric types Number and BigInt.However, the only operators you are allowed to overload between your custom type and the String type are &quot;==&quot; and &quot;&amp;lt;&quot;.The Operators function will return a constructor that you will usually want to extend in your own class.Instances of that class will respect your overloaded operator definitions.Whenever you use an operator on an object with overloaded operators, the following happens:1) Every operand that does not have overloaded operators is coerced to a primitive.  2) If there is an applicable overload for this pairing of operands, it is called. Otherwise, a TypeError is thrown.Notably, your objects with overloaded operators will not be coerced to primitives when applying operators and you can get TypeErrors when applying undefined operators to them.There are two exceptions to this:1) If you are using the + operator and one of the arguments is a string (or an object without overloaded operators that coerces to a string via ToPrimitive), then the result will be a concatenation of the ToString values of the two operands.  2) If you are using the == operator and there is no applicable overload found, the two operands are assumed to be different (x == y will return false and x != y will return true).Differences from the ProposalThere a few differences between the proposal (as defined by its specification and prototype implementation) and our implementation in GraalVM JavaScript:  You do not have to use the with operators from construction to enable the use of overloaded operators. When you overload operators for a class, those operators can then be used anywhere without using with operators from. Furthermore, our parser will not accept the with operators from clause as valid JavaScript.  You cannot use decorators to define overloaded operators. At the time of implementing this proposal, GraalVM JavaScript does not support decorators (these are still an in-progress proposal).  You cannot overload the &quot;[]&quot; and &quot;[]=&quot; operators for reading and writing integer-indexed elements. These two operators require more complex treatment and are not currently supported.",

          "content": "Optimizing Truffle InterpretersThis document discusses tools for optimizing or debugging Truffle interpreters for peak temporal performance.Strategy      Run with a profiler to sample the application and identify responsible compilation units. Use a sampling delay (--cpusampler.Delay=MILLISECONDS) to only profile after warmup. See the Profiling guide.        Understand what is being compiled and look for deoptimizations. Methods that are listed to run mostly in the interpreter likely have a problem with deoptimization.        Simplify the code as much as possible where it still shows the performance problem.        Enable performance warnings and list boundary calls.    Dump the Graal graph of the responsible compilation unit and look at the phase After TruffleTier.          Look at the Graal graphs at the phases After TruffleTier and After PartialEscape and check if it is what you would expect.If there are nodes there that you don’t want to be there, think about how to guard against including them.If there are more complex nodes there than you want, think about how to add specialisations that generate simpler code.If there are nodes you think should be there in a benchmark that are not, think about how to make values dynamic so they are not optimized away.            Search for Invoke nodes in the Graal IR. Invoke nodes that are not representing guest language calls should be specialized away. This may not be always possible, e.g., if the method does I/O.        Search for control flow splits (red lines) and investigate whether they result from control flow caused by the guest application or are just artifacts from the language implementation. The latter should be avoided if possible.    Search for indirections in linear code (Load and LoadIndexed) and try to minimize the code. The less code that is on the hot-path the better.Truffle Compiler OptionsA full list of the latest expert and internal options can be found in the Options guide.Observing CompilationsThis section provides an overview of most of the available command line options to observe compilations.Note: Most options also require the additional --experimental-options flag set.The --engine.TraceCompilation command prints a line each time a method is compiled:[engine] opt done   id=244   EqualityConstraint.execute                         |Tier 1|Time   268( 220+47  )ms|AST   17|Inlined   0Y   2N|IR    238/   437|CodeSize    1874|Timestamp 758868036671903|Src octane-deltablue.js:528Here is a quick overview of the information provided in these logs:  id - Unique identifier of the call target.  Tier - For which compilation tier was the targed scheduled.  Time - How long did the compilation last, with separation between the Truffle tier (mainly partial evaluation) and the Graal Tiers.  AST - The targets non-trivial node count.  Inlined - How many calls were inlined and how many remained calls after inlining.  IR - Graal node count after partial evaluation and after compilation.  CodeSize - The size of the code generated for the call target.  Timestamp - The time when the event happened as reported by System.nanoTime().  Src - Abbreviated source section of the call target.The --engine.TraceCompilationDetails command prints a line when compilation is queued, unqueued, started, or completed:[engine] opt queued id=237   BinaryConstraint.output                            |Tier 1|Count/Thres         25/       25|Queue: Size    1 Change +1  Load  0.06 Time     0us|Timestamp 758865671350686|Src octane-deltablue.js:416[engine] opt start  id=237   BinaryConstraint.output                            |Tier 1|Priority        25|Rate 0.000000|Queue: Size    0 Change +0  Load  0.06 Time     0us|Timestamp 758865708273384|Src octane-deltablue.js:416[engine] opt queued id=239   OrderedCollection.size                             |Tier 1|Count/Thres         25/       25|Queue: Size    1 Change +1  Load  0.06 Time     0us|Timestamp 758865727664193|Src octane-deltablue.js:71[engine] opt queued id=52    Array.prototype.push                               |Tier 1|Count/Thres         25/       50|Queue: Size    2 Change +1  Load  0.13 Time     0us|Timestamp 758865744191674|Src &amp;lt;builtin&amp;gt;:1... more log ...[engine] opt start  id=239   OrderedCollection.size                             |Tier 1|Priority    181875|Rate 0.000001|Queue: Size   11 Change -1  Load  0.63 Time   575us|Timestamp 758866381654116|Src octane-deltablue.js:71[engine] opt done   id=237   BinaryConstraint.output                            |Tier 1|Time   717( 654+64  )ms|AST   19|Inlined   0Y   0N|IR    143/   220|CodeSize     882|Timestamp 758866435391354|Src octane-deltablue.js:416[engine] opt start  id=236   BinaryConstraint.input                             |Tier 1|Priority    144000|Rate 0.000001|Queue: Size   10 Change -1  Load  0.56 Time    48us|Timestamp 758866452554530|Src octane-deltablue.js:409... more log ...[engine] opt queued id=239   OrderedCollection.size                             |Tier 2|Count/Thres       8750/     8125|Queue: Size   18 Change +1  Load  0.81 Time     0us|Timestamp 758867756295139|Src octane-deltablue.js:71[engine] opt queued id=237   BinaryConstraint.output                            |Tier 2|Count/Thres       8499/     8750|Queue: Size   19 Change +1  Load  0.88 Time     0us|Timestamp 758867758263099|Src octane-deltablue.js:416[engine] opt start  id=244   EqualityConstraint.execute                         |Tier 1|Priority   2618289|Rate 0.000015|Queue: Size   19 Change -1  Load  0.88 Time   180us|Timestamp 758867767116908|Src octane-deltablue.js:528... more log ...[engine] opt done   id=246   OrderedCollection.at                               |Tier 2|Time    89(  80+9   )ms|AST   15|Inlined   0Y   0N|IR     50/   110|CodeSize     582|Timestamp 758873628915755|Src octane-deltablue.js:67[engine] opt start  id=237   BinaryConstraint.output                            |Tier 2|Priority    173536|Rate 0.000054|Queue: Size   18 Change -1  Load  0.94 Time    18us|Timestamp 758873629411012|Src octane-deltablue.js:416[engine] opt queued id=238   Planner.addPropagate                               |Tier 2|Count/Thres       9375/     8750|Queue: Size   19 Change +1  Load  0.88 Time     0us|Timestamp 758873663196884|Src octane-deltablue.js:696[engine] opt queued id=226   Variable.addConstraint                             |Tier 2|Count/Thres       8771/     9375|Queue: Size   20 Change +1  Load  0.94 Time     0us|Timestamp 758873665823697|Src octane-deltablue.js:556[engine] opt done   id=293   change                                             |Tier 1|Time   167( 130+37  )ms|AST   60|Inlined   0Y   6N|IR    576/  1220|CodeSize    5554|Timestamp 758873669483749|Src octane-deltablue.js:867[engine] opt start  id=270   Plan.execute                                       |Tier 2|Priority    157871|Rate 0.000072|Queue: Size   19 Change -1  Load  1.00 Time    17us|Timestamp 758873669912101|Src octane-deltablue.js:778[engine] opt done   id=237   BinaryConstraint.output                            |Tier 2|Time    58(  52+6   )ms|AST   19|Inlined   0Y   0N|IR    103/   181|CodeSize     734|Timestamp 758873687678394|Src octane-deltablue.js:416... more log ...[engine] opt unque. id=304   Date.prototype.valueOf                             |Tier 2|Count/Thres      80234/     3125|Queue: Size    4 Change  0  Load  0.31 Time     0us|Timestamp 758899904132076|Src &amp;lt;builtin&amp;gt;:1|Reason Target inlined into only callerHere is a quick overview of the information added in these logs:  Count/Thres - What is the call and loop count of the target and what is the threshold needed to add the compilation to the queue.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Controlling What Is CompiledTo make the best use of the former options, limit what is compiled to the methods that you are interested in.      --engine.CompileOnly=foo restricts compilation to methods with foo in their name. Use this in combination with returning a value or taking parameters to avoid code being compiled away.        --engine.CompileImmediately compiles methods as soon as they are run.        --engine.BackgroundCompilation=false compiles synchronously, which can simplify things.        --compiler.Inlining=false disables inlining which can make code easier to understand.        --engine.OSR=false disables on-stack-replacement (compilation of the bodies of while loops for example) which can make code easier to understand.        --engine.Compilation=false turns off Truffle compilation all together.  Debugging DeoptimizationsSometimes compiled code deoptimizes (goes from Truffle compiled code back to the interpreter) unexpectedly.These are some ways to investigate why the code is deoptimized.It is very important for performance to avoid repeated deoptimizations.The --engine.TraceCompilation option shows deoptimizations with an [engine] opt deopt prefix, which is useful to evaluate if many deoptimizations happen.However, it shows no other details.Materializing a frame with FrameInstance#getFrame(READ_WRITE|MATERIALIZE) from the stack causes deoptimizations (but no invalidation).These deoptimizations can be traced with --engine.TraceDeoptimizeFrame.When using native images, you need to build the native image with -H:+IncludeNodeSourcePositions to enable stack traces for deoptimizations.These are disabled by default to save on image size.On natives images, --engine.TraceTransferToInterpreter prints an accurate stack trace for any deoptimization, it is effectively the same as --vm.XX:+TraceDeoptimization --engine.NodeSourcePositions.This is often the most efficient way to find where a deoptimization comes from thanks to the stracktrace.[Deoptimization initiated    name: String#[]    sp: 0x7ffd7b992710  ip: 0x7f26a8d8079f    reason: TransferToInterpreter  action: InvalidateReprofile    debugId: 25  speculation: jdk.vm.ci.meta.SpeculationLog$NoSpeculationReason@13dbed9e    stack trace that triggered deoptimization:        at org.truffleruby.core.string.StringNodesFactory$StringSubstringPrimitiveNodeFactory$StringSubstringPrimitiveNodeGen.execute(StringNodesFactory.java:12760)        at org.truffleruby.core.string.StringNodes$GetIndexNode.substring(StringNodes.java:836)        at org.truffleruby.core.string.StringNodes$GetIndexNode.getIndex(StringNodes.java:650)        at org.truffleruby.core.string.StringNodesFactory$GetIndexNodeFactory$GetIndexNodeGen.execute(StringNodesFactory.java:1435)        at org.truffleruby.language.RubyCoreMethodRootNode.execute(RubyCoreMethodRootNode.java:53)        at com.oracle.truffle.runtime.OptimizedCallTarget.executeRootNode(OptimizedCallTarget.java:632)        at com.oracle.truffle.runtime.OptimizedCallTarget.profiledPERoot(OptimizedCallTarget.java:603)[Deoptimization of frame    name: String#[]    sp: 0x7ffd7b992710  ip: 0x7f26a8d8079f    stack trace where execution continues:        at org.truffleruby.core.string.StringNodesFactory$StringSubstringPrimitiveNodeFactory$StringSubstringPrimitiveNodeGen.execute(StringNodesFactory.java:12760) bci 99  return address 0x4199a1d        at org.truffleruby.core.string.StringNodes$GetIndexNode.substring(StringNodes.java:836) bci 32 duringCall  return address 0x41608e0        at org.truffleruby.core.string.StringNodes$GetIndexNode.getIndex(StringNodes.java:650) bci 25 duringCall  return address 0x415f197        at org.truffleruby.core.string.StringNodesFactory$GetIndexNodeFactory$GetIndexNodeGen.execute(StringNodesFactory.java:1435) bci 109 duringCall  return address 0x4182391        at org.truffleruby.language.RubyCoreMethodRootNode.execute(RubyCoreMethodRootNode.java:53) bci 14 duringCall  return address 0x4239a29        at com.oracle.truffle.runtime.OptimizedCallTarget.executeRootNode(OptimizedCallTarget.java:632) bci 9 duringCall  return address 0x3f1c4c9        at com.oracle.truffle.runtime.OptimizedCallTarget.profiledPERoot(OptimizedCallTarget.java:603) bci 37 duringCall  return address 0x3f1d965]]On HotSpot, --engine.TraceTransferToInterpreter prints a stack trace only for explicit deoptimizations via CompilerDirectives.transferToInterpreterAndInvalidate() or CompilerDirectives.transferToInterpreter().The reported location can be incorrect if the deoptimization was caused by something else.In that case it will report the stracktrace of the next CompilerDirectives.transferToInterpreter* call even though it is not the cause.[engine] transferToInterpreter at  BinaryConstraint.output(../../../../4dev/js-benchmarks/octane-deltablue.js:416)    Constraint.satisfy(../../../../4dev/js-benchmarks/octane-deltablue.js:183)    Planner.incrementalAdd(../../../../4dev/js-benchmarks/octane-deltablue.js:597) &amp;lt;split-609bcfb6&amp;gt;

It is available here.A typical usage is --vm.Djdk.graal.Dump=:3.Files are put into a graal_dumps directory which you should then open in the C1 Visualizer.DisassemblerTHe --vm.XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions --vm.XX:+PrintAssembly commands combination prints assembly code.You will need to install hsdis using mx hsdis in graal/compiler, or manually install it into the current directory from here.Typical usage is --vm.Djdk.graal.Dump --vm.Djdk.graal.PrintBackendCFG=true. Files areput into a graal_dumps directory which you should then open in theC1 Visualizer.Combine with --vm.XX:TieredStopAtLevel=0 to disable compilation of runtime routines so that it’s easier to find your guest-language method.Note: You can also look at assembly code in the C1 Visualizer.These have been the most common and powerful ways to optimize or debug Truffle interpreters.",

          "content": "Compiler Configuration on JVMThe options for configuring the Graal compiler on the JVM are in 3 categories.General OptionsThese are general options for setting/getting configuration details.  -XX:-UseJVMCICompiler: This disables use of the Graal compiler as the top tier JIT.This is useful when wanting to compare performance of the Graal compiler against the native JIT compilers.      -Djdk.graal.CompilerConfiguration=&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;: Selects the Graal compiler configuration to use. If omitted, the compilerconfiguration with the highest auto-selection priority is used. To see the setof available configurations, supply the value help to this option.    The names of the compiler configurations and their semantics are:          enterprise: Produces highly optimized code with a possible trade-off to compilation time (only available in Oracle GraalVM).      community: Produces reasonably optimized code with a faster compilation time.      economy: Compiles as fast as possible with less optimal throughput of the generated code.            -Djdk.graal.ShowConfiguration=none: Prints information about the Graal compiler configuration selected.  This option only produces output when the compiler is initialized. By default, the Graal compiler is  initialized on the first top-tier compilation. For this reason, the way to use this option  is as follows: java -XX:+EagerJVMCI -Djdk.graal.ShowConfiguration=info -version.    The accepted values for this option are:          none: To show no information.      info: To print one line of output describing the compiler configuration in use and whether it is loaded from a Native Image (“libgraal”) or from class files (“jargraal”).      verbose: To print detailed compiler configuration information.            -Djdk.graal.MitigateSpeculativeExecutionAttacks=None: Selects a strategy to mitigate speculative  execution attacks (e.g., SPECTRE).    Accepted values are:          None: No mitigations are used in JIT compiled code.      AllTargets: All branches are protected against speculative attacks. This has a largeperformance impact.      GuardTargets: Only branches that preserve Java memory safety are protected. This hasreduced performance impact.      NonDeoptGuardTargets: Same as GuardTargets except that branches which deoptimize arenot protected since they can not be executed repeatedly.      Performance Tuning Options  -Djdk.graal.UsePriorityInlining={ true | false }: To disable use of the advanced inlining algorithm that favours throughput over compilation speed (only available in Oracle GraalVM). (Default: true.)  -Djdk.graal.Vectorization={ true | false }: To disable the auto vectorization optimization (only available in Oracle GraalVM). (Default: true.)  -Djdk.graal.OptDuplication={ true | false }: To disable the path duplication optimization (only available in Oracle GraalVM). (Default: true.)  -Djdk.graal.TuneInlinerExploration=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;: To tune for better peak performance or faster warmup.It automatically adjusts values governing the effort spent during inlining. The value of the option is a float clamped between -1 and 1 inclusive. Anything below 0 reduces inlining effort and anything above 0 increases inlining effort. In general, peak performance is improved with more inlining effort while less inlining effort improves warmup (albeit to a lower peak). Note that this option is only a heuristic and the optimal value can differ from application to application (only available in Oracle GraalVM).      -Djdk.graal.TraceInlining={ true | false }: To enable tracing of inlining decisions. This can be used for advanced tuning where it may be possible to change the source code of the application. (Default: false.)   The output format is shown below:    compilation of &#39;Signature of the compilation root method&#39;:at &#39;Sig of the root method&#39; [&#39;Bytecode index&#39;]: &amp;lt;&#39;Phase&#39;&amp;gt; &#39;Child method signature&#39;: &#39;Decision made about this callsite&#39;  at &#39;Signature of the child method&#39; [&#39;Bytecode index&#39;]:     |--&amp;lt;&#39;Phase 1&#39;&amp;gt; &#39;Grandchild method signature&#39;: &#39;First decision made about this callsite&#39;     --&amp;lt;&#39;Phase 2&#39;&amp;gt; &#39;Grandchild method signature&#39;: &#39;Second decision made about this callsite&#39;  at &#39;Signature of the child method&#39; [&#39;Bytecode index&#39;]: &amp;lt;&#39;Phase&#39;&amp;gt; &#39;Another grandchild method signature&#39;: &#39;The only decision made about this callsite.&#39;    For example:    compilation of java.lang.Character.toUpperCaseEx(int):at java.lang.Character.toUpperCaseEx(Character.java:7138) [bci: 22]:   ├──&amp;lt;GraphBuilderPhase&amp;gt; java.lang.CharacterData.of(int): no, bytecode parser did not replace invoke   └──&amp;lt;PriorityInliningPhase&amp;gt; java.lang.CharacterData.of(int): yes, worth inlining according to the cost-benefit analysis.at java.lang.Character.toUpperCaseEx(Character.java:7138) [bci: 26]:   ├──&amp;lt;GraphBuilderPhase&amp;gt; java.lang.CharacterDataLatin1.toUpperCaseEx(int): no, bytecode parser did not replace invoke   └──&amp;lt;PriorityInliningPhase&amp;gt; java.lang.CharacterDataLatin1.toUpperCaseEx(int): yes, worth inlining according to the cost-benefit analysis.  at java.lang.CharacterDataLatin1.toUpperCaseEx(CharacterDataLatin1.java:223) [bci: 4]:     ├──&amp;lt;GraphBuilderPhase&amp;gt; java.lang.CharacterDataLatin1.getProperties(int): no, bytecode parser did not replace invoke     └──&amp;lt;PriorityInliningPhase&amp;gt; java.lang.CharacterDataLatin1.getProperties(int): yes, worth inlining according to the cost-benefit analysis.  Diagnostic Options      -Djdk.graal.CompilationFailureAction=Silent: Specifies the action to take when compilation fails by  throwing an exception.    The accepted values are:          Silent: Print nothing to the console.      Print: Print a stack trace to the console.      Diagnose: Retry the compilation with extra diagnostics enabled. On VM exit, the collected diagnostics are saved to a zip file that can be submitted along with a bug report. A message is printed to the console describing where the diagnostics file is saved:        Graal diagnostic output saved in /Users/graal/graal_dumps/1549459528316/graal_diagnostics_22774.zip            ExitVM: Same as Diagnose except that the VM process exits after retrying.        For all values except for ExitVM, the VM continues executing.    -Djdk.graal.CompilationBailoutAsFailure=false: The compiler may not complete compilation of a method due to some property or code shape in the method (e.g., exotic uses of the jsr and ret bytecodes). In this case the compilation bails out. If you want to be informed of such bailouts, this option makes GraalVM treat bailouts as failures and thus be subject to the action specified by the -Djdk.graal.CompilationFailureAction option.  -Djdk.graal.PrintCompilation=false: Prints an informational line to the console for each completed compilation.For example:    HotSpotCompilation-11  Ljava/lang/Object;                            wait          ()V       |  591ms    12B    92B  4371kBHotSpotCompilation-175 Ljava/lang/String;                            lastIndexOf   (II)I     |  590ms   126B   309B  4076kBHotSpotCompilation-184 Ljava/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap;      setTabAt      ([Ljava/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap$Node;ILjava/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap$Node;)V  |  591ms    38B    67B  3411kBHotSpotCompilation-136 Lsun/nio/cs/UTF_8$Encoder;                    encode        ([CII[B)I |  591ms   740B   418B  4921  Setting Compiler Options with Language LaunchersThe Graal compiler properties above are usable with some other GraalVM launchers such as node, js and lli. The prefix for specifying the properties is slightly different.For example:java -XX:+EagerJVMCI -Djdk.graal.ShowConfiguration=info -versionBecomes:js --vm.Djdk.graal.ShowConfiguration=info -version  Note the -D prefix is replaced by --vm.D.Related Documentation  Graal Compiler  JVM Operations Manual",

          "content": "OptionsRunning JavaScript on GraalVM can be configured with several options.GraalVM JavaScript Launcher OptionsThese options are to control the behaviour of the js launcher:  -e, --eval CODE : evaluate the JavaScript source code, then exit the engine.    js -e &#39;print(1+2);&#39;    -f, --file FILE: load and execute the provided script file. Note that the -f flag is optional and can be omitted in most cases, as any additional argument to js will be interpreted as file anyway.    js -f myfile.js    --module FILE: load and execute the provided module file. Note that .mjs files are treated as modules by default.    js --module myfile.mjs    --version: print the version information of GraalVM JavaScript, then exit.  --strict: execute the engine in JavaScript’s strict mode.GraalVM JavaScript Engine OptionsThere are several options to configure the behavior of the GraalVM JavaScript engine.Depending on how the engine is started, the options can be passed either to the launcher or programmatically.For a full list of options of the JavaScript engine, pass the --help:js flag to the js launcher (available from GraalVM 22.1, for older releases use --help:languages).To include internal options, use --help:js:internal.Note that those lists both include stable, supported options and experimental options.Provide Options to the LauncherTo the launcher, the options are passed with --js.&amp;lt;option-name&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;:js --js.ecmascript-version=2015Provide Options Programmatically Using the Context APIWhen started from Java using GraalVM’s Polyglot API, the options are passed programmatically to the Context object:Context context = Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;)                         .option(&quot;js.ecmascript-version&quot;, &quot;2015&quot;)                         .build();context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;42&quot;);See the Polyglot Programming reference for information on how to set options programmatically.Stable and Experimental OptionsThe available options are distinguished in stable and experimental options.If an experimental option is used, an extra flag has to be provided upfront.In the native launchers (js and node), --experimental-options has to be passed before all experimental options.When using a Context, the option allowExperimentalOptions(true) has to be called on the Context.Builder.See ScriptEngine Implementation on how to use experimental options with a ScriptEngine.Frequently Used Stable OptionsThe following stable options are frequently relevant:  --js.ecmascript-version: emulate a specific ECMAScript version. Integer value (5, 6, etc., 2015-2022), &quot;latest&quot; (latest supported version of the spec, including finished proposals), or &quot;staging&quot; (latest version including supported unfinished proposals), default is &quot;latest&quot;.  --js.foreign-object-prototype: provide JavaScript’s default prototype to foreign objects that mimic JavaScript’s own types (foreign Arrays, Objects and Functions). Boolean value, default is true.  --js.intl-402: enable ECMAScript Internationalization API. Boolean value, default is true.  --js.regexp-static-result: provide static RegExp properties containing the results of the last successful match, e.g., RegExp.$1 (legacy). Boolean value, default is true.  --js.strict: enable strict mode for all scripts. Boolean value, default is false.  --js.console: enable the console global property. Boolean value, default is true.  --js.allow-eval: allow the code generation from strings, e.g. using eval() or the Function constructor. Boolean value, default is true.  --js.timer-resolution: sets the resolution of timing functions, like Date.now() and performance.now(), in nanoseconds. Default: 1000000 (i.e. 1 ms).  --js.unhandled-rejections: configure unhandled promise rejection tracking. Accepted values are none (default, no tracking), warn (print a warning to stderr), throw (throw an exception), and handler (invoke a custom handler).For a complete list, use js --help:js:internalECMAScript VersionThis option provides compatibility to a specific version of the ECMAScript specification.It expects an integer value, where both the edition numbers (5, 6, …) and the publication years (starting from 2015) are supported.As of GraalVM 21.2, latest, staging are supported, too.The default in GraalVM 23.1 is the ECMAScript 2023 specification.GraalVM JavaScript implements some features of the future draft specification and of open proposals, if you explicitly select that version and/or enable specific experimental flags.For production settings, it is recommended to set the ecmascript-version to a released, finalized version of the specification (e.g., 2022).Available versions are:  5 for ECMAScript 5.x  2015 (or 6) for ECMAScript 2015  2016 (or 7) for ECMAScript 2016  2017 (or 8) for ECMAScript 2017  2018 (or 9) for ECMAScript 2018  2019 (or 10) for ECMAScript 2019  2020 (or 11) for ECMAScript 2020  2021 (or 12) for ECMAScript 2021 (default in 21.3)  2022 (or 13) for ECMAScript 2022 (default in 22.0+)  2023 (or 14) for ECMAScript 2023 (default in 23.1)  latest for the latest supported language version (the default version)  staging for the latest supported language features including experimental unstable, unfinished proposals (do not use in production!)intl-402This option enables ECMAScript’s Internationalization API.It expects a Boolean value and the default is true.Strict ModeThis option enables JavaScript’s strict mode for all scripts.It expects a Boolean value and the default is false.Frequently Used Experimental OptionsNote that these options are experimental and are not guaranteed to be maintained or supported in the future.To use them, the --experimental-options flag is required or the experimental options have to be enabled on the Context, see above.  --js.nashorn-compat: provide compatibility mode with the Nashorn engine. Sets ECMAScript version to 5 by default. Might conflict with newer ECMAScript versions. Boolean value, default is false.  --js.timezone: set the local time zone. String value, default is the system default.  --js.v8-compat: provide better compatibility with Google’s V8 engine. Boolean value, default is false.  --js.esm-eval-returns-exports: context.eval of an ES module Source returns its exported symbols.  --js.temporal: enable  Temporal API.  --js.webassembly: enable WebAssembly API.",

          "content": "Basic Usage of Profile-Guided OptimizationTo explain the usage of PGO in the context of GraalVM Native Image, let’s consider the “Game Of Life” example application.It is an implementation of Conway’s Game of Life simulation on a 4000 by 4000 grid.The application takes as input a file specifying the initial state of the world, a file path to output the final state, and an integer declaring how many iterations of the simulation to run.Note that this is a not-illustrative-of-the-real-world application, but it should serve well as an example.Below is the source code of the application, modified from this resource.import java.io.BufferedReader;import java.io.FileReader;import java.io.FileWriter;public class GameOfLife {    private static final int M = 4000;    private static final int N = 4000;    public static void main(String[] args) {        new GameOfLife().run(args);    }    private void run(String[] args) {        if (args.length &amp;lt; 3) {            System.err.println(&quot;Too few arguments, need input file, output file and number of generations&quot;);            System.exit(1);        }        String input = args[0];        String output = args[1];        int generations = Integer.parseInt(args[2]);        int[][] grid = loadGrid(input);        for (int i = 1; i &amp;lt;= generations; i++) {            grid = nextGeneration(grid);        }        saveGrid(grid, output);    }    static int[][] nextGeneration(int[][] grid) {        int[][] future = new int[M][N];        for (int l = 0; l &amp;lt; M; l++) {            for (int m = 0; m &amp;lt; N; m++) {                applyRules(grid, future, l, m, getAliveNeighbours(grid, l, m));            }        }        return future;    }    private static void applyRules(int[][] grid, int[][] future, int l, int m, int aliveNeighbours) {        if ((grid[l][m] == 1) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (aliveNeighbours &amp;lt; 2)) {            // Cell is lonely and dies            future[l][m] = 0;        } else if ((grid[l][m] == 1) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (aliveNeighbours &amp;gt; 3)) {            // Cell dies due to over population            future[l][m] = 0;        } else if ((grid[l][m] == 0) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (aliveNeighbours == 3)) {            // A new cell is born            future[l][m] = 1;        } else {            // Remains the same            future[l][m] = grid[l][m];        }    }    private static int getAliveNeighbours(int[][] grid, int l, int m) {        int aliveNeighbours = 0;        for (int i = -1; i &amp;lt;= 1; i++) {            for (int j = -1; j &amp;lt;= 1; j++) {                if ((l + i &amp;gt;= 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; l + i &amp;lt; M) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (m + j &amp;gt;= 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; m + j &amp;lt; N)) {                    aliveNeighbours += grid[l + i][m + j];                }            }        }        // The cell needs to be subtracted from its neighbours as it was counted before        aliveNeighbours -= grid[l][m];        return aliveNeighbours;    }    private static void saveGrid(int[][] grid, String output) {        try (FileWriter myWriter = new FileWriter(output)) {            for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; M; i++) {                for (int j = 0; j &amp;lt; N; j++) {                    if (grid[i][j] == 0)                        myWriter.write(&quot;.&quot;);                    else                        myWriter.write(&quot;*&quot;);                }                myWriter.write(System.lineSeparator());            }        } catch (Exception e) {            throw new IllegalStateException();        }    }    private static int[][] loadGrid(String input) {        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(input))) {            int[][] grid = new int[M][N];            for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; M; i++) {                String line = reader.readLine();                for (int j = 0; j &amp;lt; N; j++) {                    if (line.charAt(j) == &#39;*&#39;) {                        grid[i][j] = 1;                    } else {                        grid[i][j] = 0;                    }                }            }            return grid;        } catch (Exception e) {            throw new IllegalStateException(e);        }    }}Application performance is measured in terms of elapsed time.The assumption is that applying better optimizations to the application results in the application taking less time to complete a workload.To see the difference in performance, you can run the application in two different ways: first, without PGO and then with PGO.Building the ApplicationThe prerequisite is to install Oracle GraalVM. The easiest way to get started is with SDKMAN!.For other installation options, visit the Downloads section.  Note: PGO is not available in GraalVM Community Edition.The first step is to compile GameOfLife.java to a class file:javac GameOfLife.javaNext, build a native image of the application, specifying a unique name with the -o option:native-image -cp . GameOfLife -o gameoflife-defaultNow you can move on to building a PGO-enabled native image. For that, you first need to build an “instrumented binary” that will produce a profile for the runtime behaviour of the application by adding the --pgo-instrumented option and specifying a different name, as follows:native-image  --pgo-instrument -cp . GameOfLife -o gameoflife-instrumentedNow run that instrumented binary to gather profiles. By default, just before exiting, it generates a file with the default name default.iprof in the current working directory, but you can specify a different name and path for the profile by passing the -XX:ProfilesDumpFile option when running the instrumented binary.You should also provide the standard expected inputs to the application: the initial state of the world (input.txt), a file to which the application will print the final state of the world (output.txt), and the desired number of iterations you want (in this case 10)../gameoflife-instrumented -XX:ProfilesDumpFile=gameoflife.iprof input.txt output.txt 10Having a runtime profile of the application contained in the gameoflife.iprof file,  you can finally build an optimized native executable by using the --pgo option and providing the gathered profile as shown below.native-image -cp . GameOfLife -o gameoflife-pgo --pgo=gameoflife.iprofWith all this in place, you can move on to the evaluating the runtime performance of the application running in the different modes.Evaluating PerformanceTo evaluate the performance, run both native executables of the application with the same inputs.You can measure the elapsed time of the executable via the time command with a custom output format (--format=&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Elapsed: %es).  Note: The CPU clock is fixed to 2.5GHz during all the measurements to minimize noise and improve reproducibility.Running with a Single IterationRun the application as shown below, so that it iterates only once:time  ./gameoflife-default input.txt output.txt 1    &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Elapsed: 1.67stime  ./gameoflife-pgo input.txt output.txt 1    &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Elapsed: 0.97sLooking at the elapsed time, you can see that running the PGO-optimized native executable is substantially faster in terms of percentage.With that in mind, the half a second of difference does not have a huge impact for a single run of this application,but if this was a serverless application that executes frequently, then the cumulative performance gain would start to add up.Run with 100 IterationsNow move on to running the application with 100 iterations. Same as before, the executed commands and the time output is shown below:time  ./gameoflife-default input.txt output.txt 100    &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Elapsed: 24.02stime  ./gameoflife-pgo input.txt output.txt 100    &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Elapsed: 13.25sIn both evaluation runs, the PGO-optimized native executable significantly outperforms the default native build.The amount of improvement that PGO provides in this case is not representative of the PGO gains for real world applications, since this application is small and does exactly one thing so the profiles provided are based on the exact same workload that is being measured.However, it illustrates the general point: Profile-Guided Optimization enables an AOT compiler to perform similar optimizations as a JIT compiler.Executable SizeAnother advantage of using PGO with GraalVM Native Image is the size of the native executable. To measure the size of the files, you can use the Linux du command as shown below.du -hs gameoflife-default    7.9M    gameoflife-defaultdu -hs gameoflife-pgo    6.7M    gameoflife-pgoAs you can see, the PGO-optimized native executable is approximately 15% smaller than the default native build.This is because the profiles provided for the optimizing build allow the compiler to differentiate between which code is important for performance(i.e., hot code), and which is not important (i.e., cold code, such as error handling).With this differentiation available, the compiler can decide to focus more heavily on optimizing the hot code and less, or not at all, on the cold code.This is a similar approach to what a JVM does - identifies the hot parts of the code at run time and compile those parts at run time.The main difference is that  Native Image PGO does the profiling and the optimizing ahead-of-time.Further Reading  Inspecting a Profile in a Build Report  Optimize a Native Executable with Profile-Guided Optimization",

          "content": "Inspecting a Profile in a Build ReportA profile plays an essential part in efficient AOT compilation by Native Image.It contains the information about a particular execution of the application, and is used to guide additional optimizations that further improve application performance.It is often useful to visualize the information in a profile.This section explains how to inspect parts of a profile using the Native Image Build Report tool.  The Native Image Build Report tool is not available in GraalVM Community Edition.Generating a Profile VisualizationThe Build Report tool displays various data about the generated image and the build process itself.Among other things, the tool can visualize profiling information recorded by the sampler, which is useful for exploring how different methods contribute to overall execution time.The samples are aggregated into a single flame graph. The flame graph is color-coded to show how the inliner made the inlining decisions during the compilation (more on that below).To generate a comprehensive report with the visualization, pass the -H:+BuildReport and -H:+BuildReportSamplerFlamegraph options at the step when you build a PGO-optimized native executable.For example:native-image -cp . GameOfLife -o gameoflife-pgo --pgo=gameoflife.iprof -H:+BuildReport -H:+BuildReportSamplerFlamegraph  Refer to Basic Usage of Profile-Guided Optimization for the step-by-step guide.Inspecting a Profile Using a Build ReportProfiling information recorded by the Native Image sampler is visualized in form of a flame graph - a hierarchical chart that aggregates multiple stack traces.This flame graph is specialized in differentiating “hot” vs. “cold” compilation units.There are three distinct colors:  red: used for marking root methods of hot compilation units;  blue: used for all the methods inlined into a hot compilation root;  gray: represents the “cold” code.  Note: The color descriptions and other useful information are part of a chart legend, and can be toggled by clicking “?”.The graph itself provides a couple of functionalities. A user can hover over a specific method bar to see more information about that method, for example, a number of samples and the percentage related to the total number of samples. Besides that, there is the ability to “zoom” into a particular method (by clicking on it) and see all the subsequent calls in that call chain more clearly. One can reset the view using the Reset Zoom button in top-left corner.Additionally, there is a search button (Search) located in top-right corner of the graph.It can be used to highlight a specific method or a group of methods that match the search criteria (the method(s)will be colored yellow).Also, there is a Matched field that represents the group share in the total number of samples (showed underneath the chart in the right half). Note that this is also a relative share - it will be readjusted when expanding/collapsing the view.One can also use a Reset Search button to cancel the search at any time.The flame graph comes with the additional histogram (below it). It shows the individual methods’ contributions to the total execution time (descending by the number of samples). These bars are also clickable, and the click has the same effect as searching - it highlights that particular method inthe flame graph above. Additional click on that same bar resets the highlighting.Further Reading  Tracking Profile Quality  Merging Profiles from Multiple Sources",

          "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
          "content": "Frequently Asked QuestionsCan I use unit tests for profiling?Yes, it is possible, but usually not recommended.To use the unit tests to generate the profiles, you should generate an instrumented binary for your test suite, in the same way you generate a native executable for any application.For example, you could have a main() method that starts the test harness.Once the instrumented binary executes, it will dump the file with the profiles, same as any instrumented binary.Note that the quality of Profile-Guided Optimization depends on the quality of the profile that you provide as an input to the optimized native build.You should make sure that your tests accurately represent the workload that will run in production.In general, it is not easy to guarantee that, because:  Unit tests are designed to test all the corner-cases of the components, many of which are uncommon in practice (i.e., while they need to be tested and work correctly, corner-cases in your code usually do not need to be fast).  Different components of your code are not always represented with the same number of unit tests.A profile based on a unit-test suite may over-represent the importance of one component, and under-represent the importance of others.  Unit-test suites evolve over time as more and more tests get added.What might accurately represent your application’s behavior today, might not accurately represent it tomorrow.For example, you are implementing web server that serves static content.Most of the time, the web server will be reading a file from the disk or an in-memory cache, compressing that file, and sending the compressed bytes over the network.However, a good unit-test suite will test all components of the web server, including code for configuration-file parsing, cache invalidation, or remote debugging, which may execute infrequently or not at all during a typical execution of the web server.If you collect the profiles across all the unit tests, they will over-represent parts of the code that execute rarely in practice, and in this way misdirect the compiler optimizations.In conclusion, while this is possible, we do not recommend to use unit tests as profiles, because it is not clear how well they represent what the application does. What we recommend instead is to either:  Identify a subset of end-to-end tests that represent important production workloads.An end-to-end test simulates what your application does in production, and is more likely to correctly portray how and where the time is spent in your code.In the previous web server example, an end-to-end test would start the web server, send thousands of requests to retrieve various URLs, and then shut down the server.  Or, create a benchmark workload that represents what your application does in production.A good benchmark would incorporate characteristics of a typical workload.In the previous web server example, a realistic benchmark would incorporate the distribution of requests that was observed when the web-server was running in production.I.e., the benchmark would model how often a file of a particular size was requested in production, as well as the compression ratios of the files.Are PGO profiles sufficiently cross-platform, or should each target be instrumented separately?Yes, in most cases, the PGO profiles are sufficiently cross-platform.You can collect the profiles by running an instrumented binary on one platform, but then use those profiles to build an optimized native executable on a different platform.There are some cases in which Native Image uses different classes and methods depending on the platform for which the binary was built.For example, the PosixProcessPropertiesSupport class contains code that manipulates processes on POSIX-based systems, while the WindowsProcessPropertiesSupport class contains code that manipulates processes on Windows.Similarly, certain parts of the JDK contain platform-specific code.In these cases, the profile will contain entries for one platform, but the optimized native build will not find profile entries for its platform-specific code.These corner-cases are rare and typically do not result in a performance impact, but this is something to be aware of.In conclusion, the best practice is always to collect the profiles on the same platform that is the target for the optimized native executable.However, using the profiles collected on a different platform should typically work well.Can the profiling information be reused after a code change, provided it is limited, or do I need to collect new profiling information for each build?Yes, the profiling information can always be reused, and a native executable has to be correctly generated.It is not necessary to collect new profiling information for each build.Note, however, that the performance impact on the optimized native executable depends on the quality of the profiles.If the new code of the program significantly diverges from the code for which the profiles was collected, the compiler optimizations will be misled about which code is important. If the code changes are sufficiently small, or limited to the cold parts of the program, then using the old profile will usually not compromise the performance of the optimized native binary.Read more on this topic in the Tracking Profile Quality guidelines.Can I also run the benchmark with an instrumented binary?Yes, an instrumented binary can be produced for any program, including a benchmark.In fact, using a representative benchmark to collect the profiles is the recommended way of collecting profiles.Be aware that the instrumentation overhead will typically make the instrumented binary slower than the default (non-instrumented) native executable.While we continually strive to minimize the overhead of instrumentation, you will likely notice that the instrumented binary is slower,and your mileage will vary depending on the code patterns in the application that you are running.Also, note that the benchmark should ideally be representative of the workload that you expect in production.The more the benchmark’s workload corresponds to the production workload, the morely likely it is that PGO have a positive performance impacton the optimized native build.In conclusion, if the benchmark accurately represents the workload that you will be running in production, then it is a good idea to collect the profiles on the instrumented benchmark binary, and subsequently use these profiles to build an optimized native executable for your production workload.How does GraalVM generate a workload for profiling a web application?GraalVM itself does not generate a workload for profiling a web application that was compiled with Native Image.Instead, you need to use a load-testing tool to generate the workload.For example, if your web application exposes several HTTP endpoints, then you need to use a load-tester such as wrk to generate a stream of requests to those HTTP endpoints.The setup for this would be as follows: you build an instrumented binary of your web application, start it in one process, and start a load-tester such as wrk in another process.The duration of the load-test needs to be long enough to exercise the endpoints of your web application that will be most frequently accessed by the production users, using request payloads that you expect to encounter in production.For a simple web application, duration of 1 minute is typically sufficient to produce profiles of good quality (but this depends on your particular application).After the load-test completes and the web application exits, it will dump the profiles to a file.Why not collect profile in the production environment for a while? For example, collect it only on one instance of the service on Monday from 8:00 till 12:00.Yes, that is a good way to collect profiles.An instrumented binary has a certain overhead, which depends on the code patterns in a particular application.However, if only one instance uses the instrumented binary during a particular period, and all other instances of your service use a normal or PGO-optimized build, then this is generally acceptable in practice.Find more information on this topic in the Tracking Profile Quality guidelines.",

          "title": "Tracking Profile Quality",
          "content": "Tracking Profile QualityThe most challenging step when using PGO for Native Image is gathering a profile for a relevant workload.Because your source code evolves, your application is rarely static in time.It is sometimes very time consuming to go through the steps of “build-instrumented-image”, “gather-profile”, and “build-optimized-image” for every change to your source code.This document gives some answers to the question “How long can I continue to use an existing profile as my application’s source code changes over time?”Approach 1: Reuse the Profile IndefinitelyWhen you build an optimized application, Native Image aims to do the best it can with the given profile.This means that providing an out-of-date profile for your application (or even a profile for a completely different application) should not stop Native Image from producing a native executable.  Note: An incorrect profile can result in worse performance than no profile. This is because an incorrect profile can lead the compiler to spend optimization resources on the wrong elements of the application and deprioritize the important elements.All that said, reusing a single profile indefinitely for an evolving application will sooner or later turn counterproductive.Approach 2: Collect Profiles PeriodicallySince your application can periodically change, it is logical to periodically collect a fresh profile.One way to achieve this would be a daily Linux cron job that builds an instrumented version of the application using the tip of the master branch, runs a workload to gather a profile, and uploads the resulting iprof file to an FTP server from which other optimizing builds can download it.This ensures that the difference between the application version that is being built and the profile that is being used is never greater than a fixed time interval (24h in this example).However, gathering a profile periodically extends compute time, so it should be balanced against the frequency at which the application changes.If your application is relatively stable and the source code changes infrequently, then it is fine to re-profile less often.Some things to keep in mind:  Align your profiling schedule with the application-release schedule, to avoid building an application with a stale profile.  Ideally, convert the production workload into a reproducible workload, collect the profiles as part of your build, and then create an optimized native executable with profiles that are always fresh.That way, you do not risk having stale or misaligned profiles as long as your workload executes the same parts of the application that will later execute in production.Approach 3: Track the Profile-Quality Metrics Over TimeTo better understand the quality of a profile, Native Image provides two metrics that you can request when building an optimized executable: profile relevance and profile applicability.These metrics reflect the relationship between a profile and the methods and classes that appear in an optimized executable.A change in the values of these two metrics between builds (that use the same profile) indicates that the set of classes and/or methods in those builds has also changed (between the time the profile was collected and the current build).How to Obtain Profile-Quality MetricsTo calculate and print the profile-quality metrics, pass the -H:+PGOPrintProfileQuality option when building an optimized native executable. (This option is experimental.)Let’s consider the Game Of Life example application which was introduced in Basic Usage of Profile-Guided Optimizationthe:native-image -cp . GameOfLife -o gameoflife-pgo --pgo=gameoflife.iprof -H:+PGOPrintProfileQualityIn the build output, at phase 5, you should see an additional line about profile applicability and profile relevance:GraalVM Native Image: Generating &#39;gameoflife-pgo&#39; (executable)...[5/8] Inlining methods...     [***]                                                                      (0.4s @ 0.28GB)Info: PGO: Profile applicability is 21.74%. Profile relevance is 72.71%....The absolute values of these metrics do not tell you much, and should not be considered in isolation.As mentioned earlier, these metrics describe the relationship between the profile and application’s code.If you change the application and reuse the profile, you should see a change in the values of the metrics.For example, apply a simple “method-rename” refactoring to the applyRules () application method.From the profile’s perspective, the applyRules () method was removed from the set of methods in the application and a new method called applyGameRules was introduced.Rerunning the optimized build with the same profile and the modified application returns the following output:native-image -cp .

Profile relevance is 72.66%.                                                                  (6.8s @ 0.29GB)...Recall that the profile applicability in the first build was 21.74%, and now it is 21.67%.Similarly, the profile relevance in the first build was 72.71%, and now it is 72.66%.The small change to the code resulted in a small metrics value change, informing you that the profile might be slightly out-of-date.  Note: In this example you renamed of a very hot method. This change is likely to cause a performance regression since profiles cannot be applied to a hot method. A similar change made in the cold code of the application would result in a similar reduction in these metrics,but this should not impact performance.Note that these metrics are a measure of the relationship between the provided profile and the set of methods in the application, and are not in any way a measurement or prediction of any performance impact a change of the profile, application source code, or dependencies may have.These numbers also make little sense or have little utility when observed in one single build.Their utility comes from observing the metrics change when re-using profile across builds or providing a different profile for the same build of the application.Profile Quality Metric: ApplicabilityThe applicability metric answers the following question: “How applicable is this profile to the application’s methods?”.During the compilation of individual methods in the application, it keeps track of how many locations N in the code needed a profile,and how many times S a profile was available.The profile applicability metric is the ratio S / N, expressed as a percentage.This means that adding new code to the application (and not to the profile) should result in a reduction in profile applicability.This is because more code means more requests for profiles, and the same number of times that the profile can be applied (S),is divided with a larger number of total requests for profiles (N).  Note: It is wrong to expect a profile applicability of 100%.A good workload will, in almost all cases, differentiate between the hot and the cold parts of the application,and will not execute some of the cold parts of the code.For this reason, the profile will not contain any entries for the cold parts of the application (such as, for example, the exception handlers),which are anyway rarely executed in the real workload.A 100% applicability would mean that all parts of the code in the image were fully profiled, which is almost never the case in practice.Profile Quality Metric: RelevanceThe relevance metric aims answers the question: “To what extent do the profile contents match the application methods?”.When loading a profile, all its data is checked against the set of application methods, and all the entries that do not match those methods are dropped.For example, if you remove a method from a class but use a profile that still has entries for that method, then all those entries will be dropped during profile-loading.Profile relevance is the percentage of data that was not dropped during loading.This means that removing code from the application (and not from the profile) should result in the profile relevance reduction, because the percent of data in the profile which is relevant to the new application version is reduced.On the other hand, adding new code (say a new class or dependency) to the application would not affect this metric since the amount of data you need to drop from the profile does not change.  Note: It is wrong to expect that building an optimized binary of exactly the same application as the one used to gather the profile will result in the profile relevance of 100%.This is not the case because the methods of the instrumented binary and the optimized binary differ in subtle ways.For example, the instrumented binary contains code for gathering the profile data as well as code for serializing that data to a file.This code is unnecessary and thus not present in the optimized binary.Looking at the Game Of Life example, the relevance around 70% is primarily due to the application being very small (a single Java class of less than 120 lines of code). Thus the differences in the set of methods of the instrumented and the optimized binary are rather exaggerated.For larger, real-world applications, this percentage is typically larger, but not 100%.Further Reading  Merging Profiles from Multiple Sources  PGO Frequently Asked Questions",

          "content": "Profile-Guided OptimizationWhat is Profile-Guided Optimization?One advantage that a just-in-time (JIT) compiler has over an ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler is its ability to analyze the run-time behavior of an application.For example, HotSpot keeps track of how many times each branch of an if statement is executed.This information, called a “profile”, is passed to a tier-2 JIT compiler (such as Graal).The tier-2 JIT compiler then assumes that the if statement will continue to behave in the same manner, and uses the information from the profile to optimize that statement.An AOT compiler typically does not have profiling information, and is usually limited to a static view of the code.This means that, barring heuristics, an AOT compiler sees each branch of every if statement as equally likely to occur at run time; each method is as likely to be invoked as any other; and each loop repeats the same number of times.This puts an AOT compiler at a disadvantage—without profiling information, it is difficult to generate machine code of the same quality as a JIT compiler.Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO) is a technique that brings profile information to an AOT compiler to improve the quality of its output in terms of performance and size.  Note: PGO is not available in GraalVM Community Edition.What Is a Profile?A profile is a summarised log of how many times certain events occurred during an application’s run time.The events are chosen according to which information can be useful for the compiler to make better decisions.Examples include:  How many times was this method called?  How many times did this if statement take the true branch? How many times did it take the false branch?  How many times did this method allocate an object?  How many times was a String value passed to a particular instanceof check?How Do I Obtain a Profile of My Application?When running an application on a JVM with a JIT compiler, the profiling of the application is handled by the runtime environment, with no extra steps needed from a developer.However, creating a profile adds execution time and memory usage overheads to the performance of the application that is being profiled.This causes warmup issues: the application will reach predictable peak performance only after sufficient time has passed for the application code to be profiled and JIT-compiled.For long-running applications, this overhead usually pays for itself, yielding a performance boost later.On the other hand, for short-lived applications and applications that need to start with predictable performance as soon as possible, this is counterproductive.Gathering a profile for an AOT-compiled application is more involved, and requires extra steps by the developer, but introduces no overhead in the final application.A profile must be gathered by observing the application while it is running.This is commonly achieved by compiling the application in a special mode that inserts instrumentation code into the application binary.The instrumentation code increments counters for the events that are of interest to the profile.A binary that includes instrumentation code is then called an instrumented binary, and the process of adding these counters is called instrumentation.Naturally, an instrumented binary of the application is not as performant as a default binary due to the overhead of the instrumentation code, so it is not recommended to run it in production.But, running synthetic representative workloads on the instrumented binary provides a representative profile of the application’s behavior.When building an optimized application, the AOT compiler has both a static view and a dynamic profile of the application.Thus, the optimized application performs better than the default AOT-compiled application.How Does a Profile “Guide” Optimization?During compilation, a compiler has to make decisions about optimizations.For example, in the following method, the function-inlining optimization needs to decide which call sites to inline, and which not.private int run(String[] args) {    if (args.length &amp;lt; 3) {        return handleNotEnoughArguments(args);    } else {        return doActualWork(args);    }}For illustrative purposes, imagine that the inlining optimization has a limit on how much code can be generated, and can hence only inline one of the calls.Looking only at the static view of the code being compiled, both the doActualWork() and handleNotEnoughArguments() invocations look pretty much indistinguishable.Without any heuristics, the phase would have to guess which is the better choice to inline.However, making the incorrect choice can lead to code that is less efficient.Assume that run() is most commonly called with the right number of arguments at run time, then inlining handleNotEnoughArguments would increase the code size of the compilation unit without giving any performance benefit since the call to doActualWork()needs to still be made most of the time.Having a run-time profile of the application can give the compiler data to differentiate between the calls.For example, if the run-time profile recorded the if condition as being false 100 times and true 3 times, then it should inline doActualWork(). This is the essence of PGO - using information from the profile to give the compiler grounding in data when making certain decisions.The actual decisions and the actual events the profile records vary from phase to phase, but the preceding example illustrates the general idea.Notice that PGO expects a representative workload to be run on the instrumented binary of the application.Providing a counter-productive profile (a profile that records the exact opposite of the actual runtime behaviour of the application) will be counter-productive.For the above example, this would be running the instrumented binary with a workload that invokes the run() method with too few arguments, while the actual application does not.This would lead to the inlining phase choosing to inline handleNotEnoughArguments reducing the performance of the optimized binary.Hence, the goal is to gather profiles on workload that match the production workloads as much as possible.The gold standard for this is to run the exact same workloads you expect to run in production on the instrumented binary.For a more detailed usage overview, go to Basic Usage of Profile-Guided Optimizations documentation.Further Reading  Basic Usage of Profile-Guided Optimizations  Inspecting a Profile in a Build Report  Merging Profiles from Multiple Sources  Tracking Profile Quality Over Time  Frequently Asked Questions",

          "content": "Python PerformanceExecution PerformanceGraalPy uses the state-of-the-art just-in-time (JIT) compiler of GraalVM.When JIT compiled, GraalPy runs Python code ~4x faster than CPython on the official Python Performance Benchmark Suite.These benchmarks can be run by installing the pyperformance package and calling pyperformance run on each of CPython and GraalPy.To get the Jython numbers we adapted the harness and benchmarks because of missing Python 3 support in Jython.The speedup was then calculated by taking the pair-wise intersection of working benchmarks and calculating the geomean.Without a JIT compiler, GraalPy currently executes pure Python code around ~4x slower than CPython.This means that very short running scripts or scripts running without the Graal compiler on Oracle JDK or OpenJDK are expected to be slower.Many Python packages from the machine learning or data science ecosystems contain C extension code.This code benefits little from GraalPy’s JIT compilation and suffers from having to emulate CPython implementation details on GraalPy.When many C extensions are involved, performance can vary a lot depending on the specific interactions of native and Python code.Code Loading Performance and FootprintIt takes time to parse Python code so when using GraalPy to embed another language in Python, observe the general advice for embedding Graal languages related to code caching.Furthermore, some Python libraries require loading a large amount of code on startup before they can do any work.Due to the design of the Python language, incremental parsing is not possible and for some scripts, the parser may represent a significant fraction of runtime and memory.To mitigate this, GraalPy can cache the bytecode generated during parsing in .pyc files, if appropriate file system access is configured.Creating and Managing .pyc FilesGraalPy automatically creates a .pyc file when there is an invalid or absent .pyc file that matches a corresponding .py file.When GraalPy imports a Python source file (module) during an execution for the first time, it automatically creates a corresponding .pyc file.If GraalPy imports the same module again, then it uses the existing .pyc file.That means that there are no .pyc files for source files that were not yet executed (imported).GraalPy creates .pyc files entirely through the FileSystem API, so that a Java application with embedded Python code can manage file system access.  Note: GraalPy never deletes a .pyc file.Every time GraalPy subsequently executes a script, it reuses the existing .pyc file, or creates a new one.GraalPy recreates a .pyc file if the timestamp or hashcode of the original source file is changed.GraalPy generates the hashcode based only on the Python source file by calling source.hashCode(), which is the JDK hash code over the array of source file bytes, calculated with java.util.Arrays.hashCode(byte[]).GraalPy also recreates .pyc files if a magic number in the Python parser is changed.The magic number is hard-coded in the source of Python and can not be changed by the user (unless of course that user has access to the bytecode of Python).The developers of GraalPy change the magic number when the bytecode format changes.This is an implementation detail, so the magic number does not have to correspond to the version of GraalPy (as in CPython).The magic number of pyc is a function of the actual Python runtime Java code that is running. Changes to the magic number are communicated in the release notes so that developers or system administrators can delete old .pyc files when upgrading.Note that if you use .pyc files, you must allow write-access to GraalPy at least when switching versions or modifying the original source code file.Otherwise, the regeneration of source code files will fail and every import will have the overhead of accessing each old .pyc file, parsing the code, serializing it, and trying (and failing) to write out a new .pyc file.GraalPy creates the following directory structure for .pyc files:top_directory/  __pycache__/    sourceA.graalpy.pyc    sourceB.graalpy.pyc  sourceA.py  sourceB.py  sub_directory/    __pycache__/      sourceX.graalpy.pyc    sourceX.pyBy default, GraalPy creates the __pycache__ directory on the same directory level as a source code file and in this directory all .pyc files from the same directory are stored.This directory may store .pyc files created with different versions of Python (including, for example, CPython), so the user may see files ending in .cpython3-6.pyc, for example..pyc files are largely managed automatically by GraalPy in a manner compatible with CPython. GraalPy provides options similar to CPython to specify the location of t_.pyc_ files, and if they should be written at all, and both of these options can be changed by guest code.The creation of .pyc files can be controlled in the same way as CPython:  The GraalPy launcher (graalpy) reads the PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODEenvironment variable. If this is set to a non-empty string, Python will nottry to create a .pyc file when importing a module.  The launcher command line option -B, if given, has the same effect as theabove.  Guest language code can change the attribute dont_write_bytecode of thesys built-in module at runtime to change the behavior for subsequentimports.  The GraalPy launcher reads the PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX environment variable. If set,it creates the __pycache__ directory at the path specified by theprefix, and creates a mirror of the directory structure of the source tree on-demand to store the .pyc files.  A guest language code can change the attribute pycache_prefix of the sysmodule at runtime to change the location for subsequent imports.Because the developer cannot use environment variables or CPython options tocommunicate these options to GraalPy, these options are made available as language options:  python.DontWriteBytecodeFlag - equivalent to -B or PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE  python.PyCachePrefix - equivalent to PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIXNote that a Python context will not enable writing .pyc files by default.The GraalPy launcher enables it by default, but if this is desired in the embedding use case, care should be taken to ensure that the __pycache__ location is properly managed and the files in that location are secured against manipulation in the same way as the source code files (.py) from which they were derived.Note also that to upgrade the application sources to Oracle GraalPy, old .pycfiles must be removed by the developer as required.Security ConsiderationsGraalPy performs all file operations (obtaining the data, timestamps, and writing .pyc files)via the FileSystem API. Developers can modify all of these operations by means of custom (for example, read-only) FileSystem implementations.The developer can also effectively disable the creation of .pyc files by disabling I/O permissions for GraalPy.If .pyc files are not readable, their location is not writable.If the .pyc files’ serialization data or magic numbers are corrupted in any way, the deserialization fails and GraalPy parses the .py source code file again.This comes with a minor performance hit only for the parsing of modules, which should not be significant for most applications (provided the application performs actual work in addition to loading Python code).",

          "content": "Profiling Truffle InterpretersThere is no shortage of tools for profiling interpreters written using Truffle.When running in JVM mode you can use standard JVM tooling such as VisualVM, Java Flight Recorder, and Oracle Developer Studio. When running in Native Image you can use callgrind from the Valgrind tool suite, and other system tools such as strace.As a language running on GraalVM, other GraalVM tools can be used.For a broad enough definition of profiling, you can also use the Ideal Graph Visualizer (IGV) and C1 Visualizer to inspect the compiler output.This guide is less about how to use each tool and more about suggestions for extracting the most useful information from the tools, assuming a basic knowledge of their usage.Profiling with CPU SamplerThe simplest way to profile the application level, for example, to find in which guest-language function(s) most of the time is spent, is to use CPU Sampler, which is part of the /tools suite and part of GraalVM.Simply pass --cpusampler to your language launcher:language-launcher --cpusampler --cpusampler.Delay=MILLISECONDS -e &#39;p :hello&#39;You probably want to use a sampling delay with --cpusampler.Delay=MILLISECONDS to only start profiling after warmup.

First, we need to profile the application with the JSON formatter:language-launcher --cpusampler --cpusampler.SampleInternal --cpusampler.Output=json -e &#39;p :hello&#39; &amp;gt; simple-app.jsonUse the --cpusampler.SampleInternal=true option if you want to profile internal sources, such as standard library functions.The JSON formatter encodes call graph information that isn’t available in the histogram format.To make a flame graph out of this output, however, we need to transform it into a format that folds the call stack samples into single lines.This can be done using stackcollapse-graalvm.rb from Benoit Daloze’s fork of FlameGraph.If you have not yet, you should clone this fork of FlameGraph into the parent directory.Now you can run the script to transform the output and pipe it into the script that will generate the SVG data:../FlameGraph/stackcollapse-graalvm.rb simple-app.json | ../FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl &amp;gt; simple-app.svgAt this point, you should open the SVG file in a Chromium-based web browser.Your system might have a different image manipulation application configured as the default application for SVG files.While loading the file in such an application may render a graph, it likely will not handle the interactive components of the flame graph. Firefox may work as well, but Chromium-based browsers currently seem to have better support and performance for the flame graph files.Profiling with Oracle Developer StudioOracle Developer Studio includes aPerformance Analyzer that can be used with GraalVM.Developer Studio can be downloaded from OTN and the current version at time of writing (12.6) provides a perpetual no-cost license for production use and the development of commercial applications.Using the Developer Studio Performance Analyser is straightforward. Include the path to the Developer Studio binaries in your PATH and then prefix your normal command-line with collect.For example:collect js mybenchmark.jsOn completion an “experiment” (.er) directory will have been created containing the profiling data for the command execution, test.1.er by default.To view the profiling results, use the analyzer tool:analyzer test.1.erThe analyzer GUI allows you to view the captured profiling information in several different ways, e.g., the timeline of your application, a flat function list, the call tree, a flame graph, etc.There is also a command-line tool, er_print, which can be used for outputting the profiling information in textual form, for further analysis.For full details, see the Performance Analyzer documentation.",

Several of them already exceed the best implementation of that language that existed before.PLDI 2016, June 13, 2016, Santa Barbara, CAVideo recordingSlidesGraalVM Compiler TutorialThis tutorial presents the GraalVM compiler, a high-performance dynamic compiler written in Java. Because it is highly configurable and extensible, it delivers excellent peak performance for a diverse set of managed languages including Java (beating the Java HotSpot server compiler), JavaScript (beating the V8 Crankshaft compiler), Ruby, and R. This lifts compiler research to a new level: researchers can evaluate new compiler optimizations immediately on many languages. If you are a language implementer who is curious how modern VMs like the Java HotSpot VM or the V8 JavaScript VM optimize your code, you will get all your questions answered too.In detail, the tutorial covers the following topics:  Key distinguishing features of the GraalVM compiler,  Introduction to the compiler IR: basic properties, instructions, and optimization phases  Speculative optimizations: first-class support for optimistic optimizations and deoptimization  JVMCI API: separation of the compiler from the VM  Snippets: expressing high-level semantics in low-level Java code  Compiler intrinsics: use all your hardware instructions  Using the compiler for static analysis  Custom compilations: integration of the compiler with an application or library  GraalVM compiler as a compiler for dynamic programming languagesPLDI 2017, June 18-23, Barcelona, SpainVideo recordingDownload SlidesTruffle PresentationsDebugging at Full Speed: Instrumenting Truffle-implemented

A primary goal is to support PyTorch, SciPy, and their constituent libraries, as well as to work with other data science and machine learning libraries from the rich Python ecosystem.GraalPy is distributed as an ahead-of-time compiled native executable, compact in size.GraalPy provides the following capabilities:  Replacement for CPython. Use GraalPy as a replacement for CPython. It is the most compatible, since it most closely resembles the structure of CPython installation packages.  Unique deployment mode for Python applications. Compile a Python application on GraalPy to a single native binary that embeds all needed resources.  Access to GraalVM’s language ecosystems and tools. GraalPy can run many standard Python tools as well as tools from the GraalVM ecosystem.GraalPy DistributionsGraalPy is available as GraalPy built on Oracle GraalVM and GraalPy Community.      GraalPy built on top of Oracle GraalVM provides the best experience: it comes with additional optimizations, is significantly faster and more memory-efficient. It is licensed under the GraalVM Free Terms and Conditions (GFTC) license, same as Oracle GraalVM, which permits use by any user including commercial and production use.Redistribution is permitted as long as it is not for a fee.        GraalPy Community is built on top of GraalVM Community Edition, and is fully open-source.  Two language runtime options are available for the Oracle and Community distributions of GraalPy:  Native          GraalPy is compiled ahead-of-time to a native executable.      This means that you do not need a JVM to run GraalPy and it is compact in size.        JVM          You can easily exploit Java interoperability.      Peak performance may be higher than the native option.

Find the download that matches the pattern graalpy-XX.Y.Z-linux-amd64.tar.gz or graalpy-XX.Y.Z-linux-aarch64.tar.gz (depending on your platform) and download.  Uncompress the file and update your PATH environment variable to include to the graalpy-XX.Y.Z-linux-amd64/bin (or graalpy-XX.Y.Z-linux-aarch64/bin) directory.  Note: On Oracle Linux 9, additionally install the libxcrypt library that is required for the GraalPy native runtime: yum install libxcrypt-compat.macOSThe easiest way to install GraalPy on macOS is to use Pyenv (the Python version manager).To install version 24.0.0 using Pyenv, run the following commands:pyenv install graalpy-24.0.0pyenv shell graalpy-24.0.0  Before running pyenv install, you may need to update pyenv to include the latest GraalPy versions.Alternatively, you can download a compressed GraalPy installation file from GitHub releases.  Find the download that matches the pattern graalpy-XX.Y.Z-macos-amd64.tar.gz or graalpy-XX.Y.Z-macos-aarch64.tar.gz (depending on your platform) and download.  Remove the quarantine attribute.     sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/graalpy    For example:     sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine ~/.pyenv/versions/graalpy-24.0.0    Uncompress the file and update your PATH environment variable to include to the graalpy-XX.Y.Z-macos-amd64/bin (or graalpy-XX.Y.Z-macos-aarch64/bin) directory.Windows  Find and download a compressed GraalPy installation file from GitHub releases that matches the pattern graalpy-XX.Y.Z-windows-amd64.tar.gz.  Uncompress the file and update your PATH variable to include to the graalpy-XX.Y.Z-windows-amd64/bin directory.Windows LimitationsThe Windows distribution of GraalPy has more limitations than its Linux or macOS counterpart, so not all features and packages may be available.It has the following known issues:  JLine treats Windows as a dumb terminal, with no autocomplete and limited editing capabilities in the REPL  Interactive help() in the REPL doesn’t work  Inside a virtual environment:          graalpy.cmd and graalpy.exe are broken      pip.exe cannot be used directly      pip has trouble with cache file loading, use --no-cache-dir      Only pure Python binary wheels can be installed, no native extensions or source builds      To install a package, use myvenv/Scripts/python.exe -m pip --no-cache-dir install &amp;lt;pkg&amp;gt;        Running from PowerShell works better than running from CMD, various scripts will fail on the latterInstalling PackagesThe best way of using GraalPy is from a venv virtual environment.This generates wrapper scripts and makes the implementation usable from a shell as the standard Python interpreter.  Create a virtual environment with GraalPy by running the following command:     graalpy -m venv &amp;lt;venv-dir&amp;gt;    For example:     graalpy -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/graalpy-24.0.0    Activate the environment in your shell session:     source &amp;lt;venv-dir&amp;gt;/bin/activate    For example:     source ~/.virtualenvs/graalpy-24.0.0/bin/activate  Multiple executables are available in the virtual environment, including: python, python3, and graalpy.  Note: To deactivate the Python environment (and return to your shell), run deactivate.The pip package installer is available when using a virtual environment.The GraalPy implementation of pip may choose package versions other than the latest in cases where it ships patches to make these work better.",

          "content": "Python Standalone ApplicationsGraalPy enables you to create a Python application or library as a native application or JAR file with no external dependencies.The Truffle framework on which GraalPy is built, combined with the Sulong LLVM runtime that GraalPy leverages for managed execution of Python’s native extensions, completely virtualizes all filesystem accesses, including those to the standard library and installed packages.GraalPy includes a module named standalone to create a Python binary for Linux, macOS, and Windows. The modules bundles all your application’s resources into a single file.  Prerequisite: GraalPy distribution beginning with version 23.1.0. See GraalPy releases.For example, if you want to produce a native executable from a Python file named my_script.py along with packages you have installed in a virtual environment named my_venv, run the following command:graalpy -m standalone native       --module my_script.py       --output my_binary       --venv my_envIt produces a native my_binary file which includes your Python code, the GraalPy runtime, and the Python standard library in a single, self-contained executable.Use graalpy -m standalone native --help for further options.Security ConsiderationsCreating a native executable or a JAR file that includes Python code could be seen as a mild form of obfuscation, but it does not protect your source code.Python source code is not stored verbatim into the executable (only the GraalPy bytecode is stored), but bytecode is easy to convert back into Python source code.",

          "title": "Modern Python for the JVM",
          "content": "Modern Python for the JVMFor Python version 2 (now EOL), Jython is the de facto means of interfacing Python and Java.Most existing Jython code that uses Java integration will be based on a stable Jython release—however, these are only available in Python 2.x versions.GraalPy, in contrast, is compatible with Python 3.x and does not provide full compatibility with earlier 2.x versions of Jython.To migrate code from Python 2 to Python 3, follow the official guide from the Python community.Once your Jython code is compatible with Python 3, follow this guide to iron out other differences between GraalPy and Jython.GraalPy’s first-class support for Java interoperability makes using Java libraries from Python as easy as possible, with special affordances for Java code beyond the generic interoperability support for other Graal languages (languages implemented on the Truffle framework).Not all features of Jython are supported on GraalPy.Some are supported, but disabled by default due to their negative impact on runtime performance.During migration, you can enable these features using a command line option: --python.EmulateJython.We recommend to move away from these features, however, to achieve optimal performance.Migrating Jython Scripts  To move plain Jython scripts from Jython to GraalPy, use a GraalPy JVM-based runtime.(For more information, see available GraalPy Distributions).Importing a Java PackageThere are certain features of Jython’s Java integration that are enabled by default on GraalPy.Here is an example:&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import java.awt as awt&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; win = awt.Frame()&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; win.setSize(200, 200)&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; win.setTitle(&quot;Hello from Python!&quot;)&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; win.getSize().toString()&#39;java.awt.Dimension[width=200,height=200]&#39;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; win.show()This example produces the same result when run on both Jython and GraalPy.However, when the example is run on GraalPy, only packages that are in the java namespace can be imported directly.To import classes from packages outside the java namespace, use the --python.EmulateJython option.  Note: When embedding GraalPy in a modularized application, you may have toadd exports for the required modules according to JSR 376.Additionally, it is not possible to import Java packages as Python modules in all circumstances.For example, this will work:import java.lang as langBut, this will not work:import javax.swing as swingfrom javax.swing import *Instead, import one of the classes directly:import javax.swing.Window as WindowBasic Object UsageConstructing and working with Java objects and classes is achieved with conventionalPython syntax.The methods of a Java object can also be retrieved and referenced as first class objects (bound to their instance), in the same way as Python methods. For example:&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from java.util import Random&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; rg = Random(99)&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; rg.nextInt()1491444859&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; boundNextInt = rg.nextInt&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; boundNextInt()1672896916Java-to-Python Types: Automatic ConversionMethod overloads are resolved by matching the Python arguments in a best-effort manner to the available parameter types.This approach is also taken when converting data.The goal here is to make using Java from Python as smooth as possible.The matching approach taken by GraalPy is similar to Jython, but GraalPy uses a more dynamic approach to matching—Python types emulating int or float are also converted to the appropriate Java types.This enables you, for example, to use a Pandas frame as double[][] or NumPy array elements as int[] when the elements fit into those Java primitive types.            Java type      Python type                  null      None              boolean      bool              byte, short, int, long      int, any object that has an __int__ method              float      float, any object that has a __float__ method              char      str of length 1              java.lang.String      str              byte[]      bytes, bytearray, wrapped Java array, Python list with only the appropriate types              Java arrays      Wrapped Java array or Python list with only the appropriate types              Java objects      Wrapped Java object of the appropriate type              java.lang.Object      Any object      Special Jython Module: jarrayGraalPy implements the jarray module (to create primitive Java arrays) for compatibility.For example:&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import jarray&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; jarray.array([1,2,3], &#39;i&#39;)Note that its usage is equivalent to constructing the array type using the java.type function and then populating the array, as follows:&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import java&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; java.type(&quot;int[]&quot;)(10)The code that creates a Java array can also use Python types.However, implicitly, this may produce a copy of the array data, which can be deceptive when using a Java array as an output parameter:&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; i = java.io.ByteArrayInputStream(b&quot;foobar&quot;)&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; buf = [0, 0, 0]&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; i.read(buf) # buf is automatically converted to a byte[] array3&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; buf[0, 0, 0] # the converted byte[] array is lost&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; jbuf = java.type(&quot;byte[]&quot;)(3)&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; i.read(jbuf)3&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; jbuf[98, 97, 122]Exceptions from JavaTo catch Java exceptions, use the --python.EmulateJython option.  Note: Catching a Java exception incurs a performance penalty.For example:&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import java&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; v = java.util.Vector()&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; try:...    x = v.elementAt(7)... except java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException as e:...    print(e.getMessage())...7 &amp;gt;= 0Java Collections      Java arrays and collections that implement the java.util.Collection interface can be accessed using the [] syntax. An empty collection is considered false in boolean conversions. The length of a collection is exposed by the len built-in function.For example:      &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from java.util import ArrayList  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; l = ArrayList()  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; l.add(&quot;foo&quot;)  True  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; l.add(&quot;baz&quot;)  True  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; l[0]  &#39;foo&#39;  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; l[1] = &quot;bar&quot;  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; del l[1]  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; len(l)  1  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; bool(l)  True  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; del l[0]  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; bool(l)  False        Java iterables that implement the java.lang.Iterable interface can be iterated over using a for loop or the iter built-in function and are accepted by all built-ins that expect an iterable. For example:      &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; [x for x in l]  [&#39;foo&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;]  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; i = iter(l)  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; next(i)  &#39;foo&#39;  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; next(i)  &#39;bar&#39;  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; next(i)  Traceback (most recent call last):  File &quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&quot;, line 1, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;  StopIteration  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; set(l)  {&#39;foo&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;}        An iterator can be iterated as well. For example:      &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from java.util import ArrayList  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; l = ArrayList()  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; l.add(&quot;foo&quot;)  True  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; i = l.iterator()  # Calls the Java iterator methods  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; next(i)  &#39;foo&#39;        Mapped collections that implement the java.util.Map interface can be accessed using the [] notation.An empty map is considered false in boolean conversions. Iteration of a map yields its keys, consistent with dict.For example:      &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from java.util import HashMap  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; m = HashMap()  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; m[&#39;foo&#39;] = 5  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; m[&#39;foo&#39;]  5  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; m[&#39;bar&#39;]  Traceback (most recent call last):  File &quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&quot;, line 1, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;  KeyError: bar  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; [k for k in m]  [&#39;foo&#39;]  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; bool(m)  True  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; del m[&#39;foo&#39;]  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; bool(m)  False  Inheritance from JavaInheriting from a Java class (or implementing a Java interface) is supported with some syntactical differences from Jython. To create a class that inherits from a Java class (or implements a Java interface), use the conventional Python class statement: declared methodsoverride (implement) superclass (interface) methods when their names match. To call the a superclass method, use the special attribute self.__super__. The created object does not behave like a Python object but instead in the same way as a foreign Java object.Its Python-level members can be accessed using its this attribute. For example:import atexitfrom java.util.logging import Logger, Handlerclass MyHandler(Handler):    def __init__(self):        self.logged = []    def publish(self, record):        self.logged.append(record)logger = Logger.getLogger(&quot;mylog&quot;)logger.setUseParentHandlers(False)handler = MyHandler()logger.addHandler(handler)# Make sure the handler is not used after the Python context has been closedatexit.register(lambda: logger.removeHandler(handler))logger.info(&quot;Hi&quot;)logger.warning(&quot;Bye&quot;)# The python attributes/methods of the object are accessed through &#39;this&#39; attributefor record in handler.this.logged:    print(f&#39;Python captured message &quot;{record.getMessage()}&quot; at level {record.getLevel().getName()}&#39;)Embedding Python into JavaThe other way to use Jython was to embed it into a Java application. There were two options for such an embedding.      Use the PythonInterpreter object that Jython provides.Existing code using Jython in this manner depends directly on the Jython package (for example, in the Maven configuration), because the Java code has references to Jython internal classes.These classes do not exist in GraalVM, and no equivalent classes are exposed.To migrate from this usage, switch to the GraalVM SDK.Using this SDK, no APIs particular to Python are exposed, everything is achieved via the GraalVM API, with maximum configurability of the Python runtime.Refer to the Getting Started documentation for preparing a setup.        Embed Jython in Java via JSR 223 by using the classes of the the javax.script package, and, in particular, via the ScriptEngine class.We do not recommend this approach, because the ScriptEngine APIs are not a clean fit for the options and capabilities of GraalPy.However, to migrate existing code, we provide an example ScriptEngine implementation that you can inline into your project.Refer to the reference manual for embedding for details.

          "content": "Java on TruffleUsing GraalVM, you can run Java applications normally on the JVM, in Native Image, and now on Truffle.Java on Truffle is an implementation of the Java Virtual Machine Specification, Java SE 8 and Java SE 11, built upon GraalVM as a Truffle interpreter.It is a minified Java VM that includes all core components of a VM, implements the same API as the Java Runtime Environment library (libjvm.so), and reuses all JARs and native libraries from GraalVM.See the Implementation Details for more information.The project name behind this implementation is “Espresso”.Its open source version is available on GitHub.The Java on Truffle execution mode runs Java via a Java bytecode interpreter, implemented with the Truffle framework – an open-source library for writing interpreters for programming languages.Now Java can be executed by the same principle as other languages in the GraalVM ecosystem (JavaScript, Ruby, Python, R), directly interoperate with those languages, and pass data back and forth in the same memory space.Besides complete language interoperability, with Java on Truffle you can:  run Java bytecode in a separate context from the host Java VM.  run either a Java 8, Java 11, Java 17, Java 21, or Java 22 guest JVM, allowing to embed e.g. a Java 17 context in a Java 22 application, by using GraalVM’s Polyglot API.  leverage the whole stack of tools provided by the Truffle framework, not previously available for Java.  have an improved isolation of the host Java VM and the Java program running on Truffle, so you can run less trusted guest code.  run in the context of a native executable while still allowing dynamically-loaded bytecodes.Java on Truffle passes the Java Compatibility Kit (JCK or TCK for Java SE).Getting StartedJava on Truffle (known as Espresso) is available as a standalone distribution.You can download a standalone based on Oracle GraalVM or GraalVM Community Edition.      Download the Java on Truffle (Espresso) 24.0 standalone for your operating system:          Linux x64      Linux AArch64      macOS x64      macOS AArch64      Windows x64            Unzip the archive:          Note: If you are using macOS Catalina and later you may need to remove the quarantine attribute:       sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine &amp;lt;archive&amp;gt;.tar.gz        Extact:     tar -xzf &amp;lt;archive&amp;gt;.tar.gz        A standalone comes with a JVM in addition to its native launcher. Check the version to see the Java on Truffle runtime is active:     # Path to Java on Truffle (Espresso) installation ./path/to/bin/java -truffle -version  Run Java on TruffleYou can run a Java application on Truffle by passing the -truffle flag to the standard java launcher.This is similar to how you used to switch between the -client and -server JVMs.To execute a class file:java -truffle [options] classTo execute a JAR file:java -truffle [options] -jar jarfileUsing Java 11 based GraalVM distribution, you can also run a Java application from the main class in a module, or run a single source-file program:java -truffle [options] -m module[/&amp;lt;mainclass&amp;gt;]java -truffle [options] sourcefileBy default, Java on Truffle runs within GraalVM by reusing all GraalVM’s JARs and native libraries, but it is possible to “cross-version” and specify a different Java installation directory (java.home).It will automatically switch versions regardless of the host JVM.java -truffle --java.JavaHome=/path/to/java/home -versionPerformance ConsiderationsThe startup time will not match the speed offered by the regular GraalVM just-in-time (JIT) execution yet, but having created a fully working Java on Truffle runtime, the development team is now focusing on performance.You can still influence the performance by passing the following options to java -truffle:  --engine.MultiTier=true to enable multi-tier compilation;  --engine.Inlining=false in combination with --java.InlineFieldAccessors=true to make the compilation faster, in exchange for slower performance.The --vm.XX: syntax ensures the option is passed to the underlying Native Image VM.When using the -XX: syntax, the VM first checks if there is such an option in the Java on Truffle runtime.If there is none, it will try to apply this option to the underlying Native Image VM.This might be important for options such as MaxDirectMemorySize which can be set independently at both levels: -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=256M controls how much native memory can be reserved by the Java program running on Truffle (the guest VM), while --vm.XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=256M controls how much native memory can be reserved by Native Image (the host VM).Start Running ApplicationsFrom Command LineTo ensure you have successfully installed Java on Truffle, verify its version:# Path to Java on Truffle (Espresso) installation./path/to/bin/java -truffle -versionTaking this HelloWorld.java example, compile it and run from the command line:public class HelloWorld {  public static void main(String[] args) {    System.out.println(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);  }}$JAVA_HOME/bin/javac HelloWorld.java$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -truffle HelloWorldHelloWorld.java!Taking some real-world applications, try running Spring PetClinic - a sample web application that demonstrates the use of Spring Boot with Spring MVC and Spring Data JPA.  Clone the project and navigate to the project’s directory:    git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.gitcd spring-petclinic    Build a JAR file (Spring PetClinic is built with Maven):    ./mvnw package    Then run it from the command line by selecting the -truffle runtime:    java -truffle -jar target/spring-petclinic-&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;-SNAPSHOT.jar    When the application starts, access it on localhost:8000.From IDETo run a Java project on Truffle from an IDE requires setting the Java on Truffle enabled GraalVM as a project’s default JDK.For exampe, to run the Spring PetClinic project using Intellij IDEA, you need to:1. Navigate to File, then to Project Structure. Click Project, and then click Project SDK. Expand the drop down, press Add JDK and open the folder where you installed GraalVM. For macOS users, JDK home path will be /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/{graalvm}/Contents/Home. Give it a name, and press Apply.2. Generate sources and update folders for the project. In the Maven sidebar, click on the folder with the spinner icon:3. Enable the Java on Truffle execution mode. From the main menu select Run, then Run…. Click Edit Configurations and choose Environment. Put the -truffle -XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions command in VM options and press Apply.It is necessary to specify -XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions because Intellij automatically adds a -javaagent argument which is not supported yet.4. Press Run.DebuggingYou do not have to configure anything special to debug applications running Java on Truffle from your favorite IDE debugger.For example, starting a debugger session from IntelliJ IDEA is based on the Run Configurations.To ensure you attach the debugger to your Java application in the same environment, navigate in the main menu to Run -&amp;gt; Debug… -&amp;gt; Edit Configurations, expand Environment, check the JRE value and VM options values.It should show GraalVM as project’s JRE and VM options should include -truffle -XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions: -truffle to run Java on Truffle, and -XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions as a temporary workaround since the Java on Truffle runtime does not yet support attaching Java agents.What to Read NextJava on Truffle enables a seamless Java interoperability with other languages in the GraalVM ecosystem.Check the Interoperability with Truffle Languages guide to learn how to load code written in foreign languages, export and import objects between languages, how to use Java-on-Truffle objects from a foreign language and vice versa to create powerful polyglot programs.To learn about the implementation approach, project’s current status, and known limitations proceed to Implementation Details.You can already run some large applications like the Eclipse IDE, Scala or other languages REPLs, etc. in the Java on Truffle execution mode.We recommend having a look at the collection of Demo Applications.If you have a question, check the available FAQs, or reach us directly over the #espresso channel in GraalVM Slack.",

That is, it is first interpreted before its hot methods are compiled.This mode is selected with the -XX:-UseJVMCINativeLibrary command-line option.This will delay the time to reach peak performance as the compiler itself needs to be compiled before it produces code quickly.This mode allows you to debug the Graal compiler with a Java debugger.  InteroperabilityIn addition to running JVM-based languages on GraalVM, you can also call any other language implemented with the Truffle language implementation framework directly from Java.See the Polyglot Programming and Embedding Languages guides for more information about interoperability with other programming languages.",

          "content": "Native ImageNative Image is a technology to compile Java code ahead-of-time to a binary – a native executable. A native executable includes only the code required at run time, that is the application classes, standard-library classes, the language runtime, and statically-linked native code from the JDK.An executable file produced by Native Image has several important advantages, in that it  Uses a fraction of the resources required by the Java Virtual Machine, so is cheaper to run  Starts in milliseconds  Delivers peak performance immediately, with no warmup  Can be packaged into a lightweight container image for fast and efficient deployment  Presents a reduced attack surfaceA native executable is created by the Native Image builder or native-image that processes your application classes and other metadata to create a binary for a specific operating system and architecture.First, the native-image tool performs static analysis of your code to determine the classes and methods that are reachable when your application runs.Second, it compiles classes, methods, and resources into a binary.This entire process is called build time to clearly distinguish it from the compilation of Java source code to bytecode.The native-image tool can be used to build a native executable, which is the default, or a native shared library. This quick start guide focuses on building a native executable; to learn more about native shared libraries, go here.To get used to Native Image terminology and get better understanding of the technology, we recommend you to read the Basics of Native Image.Table of Contents  Build a Native Executable  Configuring Native Image with Third-Party Libraries  Further ReadingPrerequisitesThe native-image tool, available in the bin directory of your GraalVM installation, depends on the local toolchain (header files for the C library, glibc-devel, zlib, gcc, and/or libstdc++-static). These dependencies can be installed (if not yet installed) using a package manager on your machine.Choose your operating system to find instructions to meet the prerequisites.              // BEGIN-SNIPPETOn Oracle Linux use the YUM package manager:```shell$ sudo yum install gcc glibc-devel zlib-devel```Some Linux distributions may additionally require libstdc++-static.You can install libstdc++-static if the optional repositories are enabled (_ol7_optional_latest_ on Oracle Linux 7 and _ol8_codeready_builder_ on Oracle Linux 8).On Ubuntu Linux use the `apt-get` package manager:$ sudo apt-get install build-essential zlib1g-devOn other Linux distributions use the DNF package manager:$ sudo dnf install gcc glibc-devel zlib-devel libstdc++-static// END-SNIPPET                        // BEGIN-SNIPPETOn macOS use Xcode:$ xcode-select --install// END-SNIPPET                        // BEGIN-SNIPPETTo use Native Image on Windows, install Visual Studio 2022 version 17.6.0 or later, and Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC). There are two installation options:* Install the Visual Studio Build Tools with the Windows 11 SDK (or later version)* Install Visual Studio with the Windows 11 SDK (or later version)Native Image runs in both a PowerShell or Command Prompt and will automatically set up build environments on Windows, given that it can find a suitable Visual Studio installation.// END-SNIPPET                  Linux      macOS      Windows        Build a Native ExecutableThe native-image tool takes Java bytecode as its input. You can build a native executable from a class file, from a JAR file, or from a module (with Java 9 and higher).From a ClassTo build a native executable from a Java class file in the current working directory, use the following command:native-image [options] class [imagename] [options]For example, build a native executable for a HelloWorld application.  Save this code into file named HelloWorld.java:     public class HelloWorld {     public static void main(String[] args) {         System.out.println(&quot;Hello, Native World!&quot;);     } }    Compile it and build a native executable from the Java class:     javac HelloWorld.java native-image HelloWorld    It will create a native executable, helloworld, in the current working directory.        Run the application:     ./helloworld    You can time it to see the resources used:     time -f &#39;Elapsed Time: %e s Max RSS: %M KB&#39; ./helloworld # Hello, Native World! # Elapsed Time: 0.00 s Max RSS: 7620 KB  From a JAR fileTo build a native executable from a JAR file in the current working directory, use the following command:native-image [options] -jar jarfile [imagename]The default behavior of native-image is aligned with the java command which means you can pass the -jar, -cp, -m  options to build with Native Image as you would normally do with java. For example, java -jar App.jar someArgument becomes native-image -jar App.jar and ./App someArgument.Follow this guide to build a native executable from a JAR file.From a ModuleYou can also convert a modularized Java application into a native executable.The command to build a native executable from a Java module is:native-image [options] --module &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;[/&amp;lt;mainclass&amp;gt;] [options]For more information about how to produce a native executable from a modular Java application, see Building a HelloWorld Java Module into a Native Executable.Getting Notified When the Build Process Is DoneDepending on the size of your application and the available resources of your build machine, it can take a few minutes to AOT-compile your Java application to a native executable.If you are building your project in the background, consider using a command that notifies you when the build process is completed.Below, example commands are listed per operating system:Linux# Ring the terminal bellnative-image -jar App.jar ... ; printf &#39;a&#39;# Use libnotify to create a desktop notificationnative-image -jar App.jar ... ; notify-send &quot;GraalVM Native Image build completed with exit code $?&quot;# Use Zenity to open an info dialog box with textnative-image -jar App.jar ... ; zenity --info --text=&quot;GraalVM Native Image build completed with exit code $?&quot;macOS# Ring the terminal bellnative-image -jar App.jar ... ; printf &#39;a&#39;# Use Speech Synthesisnative-image -jar App.jar ... ; say &quot;GraalVM Native Image build completed&quot;Windows# Ring the terminal bell (press Ctrl+G to enter ^G)native-image.exe -jar App.jar &amp;amp; echo ^G# Open an info dialog box with textnative-image.exe -jar App.jar &amp;amp; msg &quot;%username%&quot; GraalVM Native Image build completedBuild ConfigurationThere many options you can pass to the native-image builder to configure the build process. Run native-image --help to see the full list.The options passed to native-image are evaluated left-to-right.For different build tweaks and to learn more about build time configuration, see Native Image Build Configuration.Native Image will output the progress and various statistics during the build. To learn more about the output and the different build phases, see Build Output.Native Image and Third-Party LibrariesFor more complex applications that use external libraries, you must provide the native-image builder with metadata.Building a standalone binary with the native-image tool takes place under a “closed world assumption”. The native-image tool performs an analysis to see which classes, methods, and fields within your application are reachable and must be included in the native image. The analysis is static: it does not run your application.This means that all the bytecode in your application that can be called at run time must be known (observed and analyzed) at build time.The analysis can determine some cases of dynamic class loading, but it cannot always exhaustively predict all usages of the Java Native Interface (JNI), Java Reflection, Dynamic Proxy objects, or class path resources. To deal with these dynamic features of Java, you inform the analysis with details of the classes that use Reflection, Proxy, and so on, or what classes to be dynamically loaded.To achieve this, you either provide the native-image tool with JSON-formatted configuration files or pre-compute metadata in the code.To learn more about metadata, ways to provide it, and supported metadata types, see Reachability Metadata.To automatically collect metadata for your application, see Automatic Collection of Metadata.There are also Maven and Gradle plugins for Native Image to automate building, testing and configuring native executables. Learn more here.Some applications may need additional configuration to be compiled with GraalVM Native Image.For more details, see Native Image Compatibility Guide.Native Image can also interop with native languages through a custom API.Using this API, you can specify custom native entry points into your Java application and build it into a nativw shared library.To learn more, see Interoperability with Native Code.Further ReadingThis getting started guide is intended for new users or those with little experience of using GraalVM Native Image. We strongly recommend these users to check the Basics of Native Image page to better understand some key aspects before going deeper.Check user guides to become more experienced with GraalVM Native Image, find demo examples, and learn about potential usage scenarios.For a gradual learning process, check the Native Image Build Overview and Build Configuration documentation.Consider running interactive workshops to get some practical experience: go to Luna Labs and search for “Native Image”.If you have stumbled across a potential bug, please submit an issue in GitHub.If you would like to contribute to Native Image, follow our standard contributing workflow.",

It should produce a standalone floyd.wasm file in the current working directory:emcc -o floyd.wasm floyd.cThen you can run the compiled WebAssembly binary on GraalVM as follows:wasm --Builtins=wasi_snapshot_preview1 floyd.wasmIn this example, the flag --Builtins specifies builtin modules that the Emscripten toolchain requires.Embedding WebAssembly ProgramsThe compiled WebAssembly binary code can be accessed programmatically with GraalVM Polyglot API, which allows embedding GraalVM WebAssembly into user programs. Here is a simple example of how to call WebAssembly code from a Java application:import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;import org.graalvm.polyglot.io.ByteSequence;//Load the WASM contents into a byte arraybyte[] binary = readBytes(&quot;example.wasm&quot;);Context.Builder contextBuilder = Context.newBuilder(&quot;wasm&quot;);Source.Builder sourceBuilder = Source.newBuilder(&quot;wasm&quot;, ByteSequence.create(binary), &quot;example&quot;);Source source = sourceBuilder.build();Context context = contextBuilder.build();context.eval(source);Value mainFunction = context.getBindings(&quot;wasm&quot;).getMember(&quot;main&quot;).getMember(&quot;_start&quot;);mainFunction.execute();For more polyglot examples, visit the Embedding Languages guide.",

          "content": "GraalVM JavaScript and Node.js RuntimeGraalVM provides an ECMAScript-compliant runtime to execute JavaScript and Node.js applications.It is fully standard compliant, executes applications with high performance, and provides all benefits from the GraalVM stack, including language interoperability and common tooling.This reference documentation provides information on available JavaScript engine configurations, the Node.js runtime, the ScriptEngine implementation, multithreading support details, possible embedding scenarios, and more.To migrate the code previously targeted to the Nashorn or Rhino engines, migration guides are available.Getting StartedAs of GraalVM for JDK 21, the JavaScript (GraalJS) and Node.js runtimes are available as standalone distributions.Two standalone language runtime options are available for both Oracle GraalVM and GraalVM Community Edition: a Native Image compiled native launcher or a JVM-based runtime (included).To distinguish between them, the GraalVM Community Edition version has the suffix -community in the name: graaljs-community-&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;os&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;arch&amp;gt;.tar.gz, graalnodejs-community-&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;os&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;arch&amp;gt;.tar.gz.A standalone that comes with a JVM has a -jvm suffix in a name.      Navigate to GitHub releases and select a desired standalone for your operating system.        Unzip the archive:          Note: If you are using macOS Catalina and later, first remove the quarantine attribute:       sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine &amp;lt;archive&amp;gt;.tar.gz      Unzip:       tar -xzf &amp;lt;archive&amp;gt;.tar.gz      Alternatively, open the file in the Finder.            Check the version to see if the runtime is active:     ./path/to/bin/js --version     ./path/to/bin/node --version  Running JavaScriptUse the js launcher to run plain JavaScript (ECMAScript) code:js [options] [filename...] -- [args]Running Node.jsThe Node.js standalone provides node and npm launchers.Use the node utility to execute Node.js applications:node [options] [filename] [args]The npm command is equivalent to the default Node.js command and supports all Node.js APIs.  Install the colors and ansispan packages using npm install as follows:     npm install colors ansispan    After the packages are installed, you can use them from your application.    Add the following code snippet to a file named app.js and save it in the same directory where you installed the Node.js packages:     const http = require(&quot;http&quot;); const span = require(&quot;ansispan&quot;); require(&quot;colors&quot;); http.createServer(function (request, response) {     response.writeHead(200, {&quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;text/html&quot;});     response.end(span(&quot;Hello Graal.js!&quot;.green)); }).listen(8000, function() { console.log(&quot;Graal.js server running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/&quot;.red); }); setTimeout(function() { console.log(&quot;DONE!&quot;); process.exit(); }, 2000);    Execute it on GraalVM using the node command as follows:     node app.js  For more information about running Node.js, go to Node.js Runtime.The Node.js functionality is available when an application is started from the node binary launcher.Certain limits apply when launching a Node.js application or accessing NPM packages from a Java context, see Node.js vs. Java Script Context.Interoperability with JavaTo embed JavaScript in a Java host application, enable JavaScript by adding it as a project dependency.Below is the Maven configuration for a JavaScript embedding:&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.polyglot&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;polyglot&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;${graalvm.version}&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.polyglot&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;js&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;${graalvm.version}&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;pom&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;It enables the Oracle GraalVM JavaScript runtime by default.Use js-community if you need the artifact built on top of GraalVM Community Edition.To access Java from JavaScript, use Java.type, as in the following example:node&amp;gt; var BigInteger = Java.type(&#39;java.math.BigInteger&#39;);&amp;gt; console.log(BigInteger.valueOf(2).pow(100).toString(16));10000000000000000000000000Vice versa, you can execute JavaScript from Java by embedding the JavaScript context in the Java program:import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;import org.graalvm.polyglot.proxy.*;public class HelloPolyglot {    static String JS_CODE = &quot;(function myFun(param){console.log(&#39;hello &#39;+param);})&quot;;    public static void main(String[] args) {        System.out.println(&quot;Hello Java!&quot;);        try (Context context = Context.create()) {            Value value = context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, JS_CODE);            value.execute(args[0]);        }    }}By wrapping the function definition (()), you return the function immediately.The source code unit can be represented with a String, as in the example, a file, read from URL, and other means.This way you can evaluate JavaScript context embedded in Java, but you will not be able to call a function and set parameters in the function directly from the Java code.The Node.js runtime cannot be embedded into a JVM but has to be started as a separate process.For example, save this code as app.js:var HelloPolyglot = Java.type(&quot;HelloPolyglot&quot;);HelloPolyglot.main([&quot;from node.js&quot;]);console.log(&quot;done&quot;);Then run it:node --vm.cp=. app.jsHello Java!hello from node.jsdoneBoth Node.js and JVM then run in the same process and the interoperability works using the same Value classes as above.Learn more about language interoperability in the Java Interoperability guide.Further documentationFor additional information, see the following documentation.Using GraalVM JavaScript:  JavaScript Compatibility  Options and Flags to the Engine  Multithreading Support  Java Interoperability  Execute GraalVM JavaScript on a Stock JDKLegacy environments:  Migration Guide from Nashorn  Migration Guide from Rhino  Work with a javax.script.ScriptEngineNode.js support:  Node.js Support  Differences between node’s native launcher and a Java Context",

          "title": "Getting Started with GraalPy on the JVM",
          "content": "Go here to get started with GraalPy as CPython replacement.Getting Started with GraalPy on the JVMYou can use GraalPy with GraalVM JDK, Oracle JDK, or OpenJDK.You can easily add GraalPy to your Java application using Maven or Gradle build tools as shown below.Other build systems (for example, Ant, Make, CMake) can also be used with a bit more manual work.MavenGraalPy can generate a Maven project that embeds Python packages into a Java application using Maven artefacts.  Since version 24.0, the GraalPy project publishes a Maven archetype to generate a starter project:    mvn archetype:generate   -DarchetypeGroupId=org.graalvm.python   -DarchetypeArtifactId=graalpy-archetype-polyglot-app   -DarchetypeVersion=24.0.0    Build a native executable using the GraalVM Native Image plugin that was added for you automatically:     mvn -Pnative package    Once completed, run the executable:     ./target/polyglot_app    The application prints “hello java” to the console.  The project uses the GraalVM SDK Polyglot API with additional features to manage Python virtual environments and integrate Python package dependencies with a Maven workflow.The Java code and the pom.xml file are heavily documented and the generated code describes available features.(If you do not wish to use Maven, the archetype Java code also provides guidance to create a custom embedding.)Creating Cross-platform JARs with Native Python PackagesThe generated project uses the GraalPy Maven plugin, which makes it easy to add Python dependencies.However, Python packages may have native components that are specific to the build system.In order to distribute the resulting application for other systems, follow these steps:      Build the project on each deployment platform.Rename JAR files so they each have a platform-specific name and move them to a temporary directory on the same machine.        Unzip each of the JAR files (substituting the correct names for the JAR files).A special file, vfs/fileslist.txt needs to be concatenated from each JAR file.Finally, create a new combined.jar from the combination of all files and with the concatenated fileslist.txt.     unzip linux.jar -d combined mv combined/vfs/fileslist.txt fileslist-linux.txt unzip windows.jar -d combined mv combined/vfs/fileslist.txt fileslist-windows.txt cat fileslist-linux.txt fileslist-windows.txt &amp;gt; combined/vfs/fileslist.txt cd combined zip -r ../combined.jar *  Gradle  Create a Java application with Gradle using the command below and follow the prompts (select a build script language, select a test framework, and so on):     gradle init --type java-application              --project-name interop               --package interop              --no-split-project    The project is generated in the current working directory with the following structure:     └── app     ├── build.gradle     └── src         └── main             ├── java             │   └── interop             │       └── App.java             └── resources    Open your project configuration file, app/build.gradle, and modify it as follows.                  Include the GraalPy support and the GraalVM SDK Polyglot API in the dependencies section:          implementation(&quot;org.graalvm.polyglot:polyglot:23.1.2&quot;)  implementation(&quot;org.graalvm.polyglot:python:23.1.2&quot;)            We recommend you use the Java modules build. Add the appropriate plugin to the plugins section:          id(&quot;org.javamodularity.moduleplugin&quot;) version &quot;1.8.12&quot;            To run the application as a module rather than from the classpath, edit the application section to look like this:          application {      mainClass.set(&quot;interop.App&quot;)      mainModule.set(&quot;interop&quot;)  }              Create a new file named app/src/main/java/module-info.java with the following contents:     module interop {     requires org.graalvm.polyglot; }    Finally, replace the code in the file named App.java as follows for a small Python embedding:     package interop; import org.graalvm.polyglot.*; class App {     public static void main(String[] args) {         try (var context = Context.create()) {             System.out.println(context.eval(&quot;python&quot;, &quot;&#39;Hello Python!&#39;&quot;).asString());         }     } }    Run the application with Gradle:     ./gradlew run    The application prints “Hello Python!” to the console.    Note: The performance of the GraalPy runtime depends on the JDK in which you embed it. For more information, see Runtime Optimization Support.Ant, CMake, Makefile or Other Build Systems Without Direct Support for Maven DependenciesSome (often older) projects may be using Ant, Makefiles, CMake, or other build systems that do not directly support Maven dependencies.Projects such as Apache Ivy™ enable such build systems to resolve Maven dependencies, but developers may have reasons not to use them.GraalPy comes with a tool to obtain the required JAR files from Maven.      Assuming there is some directory where third-party dependencies are stored for the project and that the build system is set up to put any JAR files there on the classpath, the project directory tree might look similar to this:     ├───lib │   └─── ... *.jar dependencies are here └───src     └─── ... *.java files and resources are here        Install GraalPy for your system and ensure you have graalpy on your PATH.Open a command-line interface and enter your project directory.Then, as appropriate for your system, run one of the following commands:    In a POSIX shell:     export GRAALPY_HOME=$(graalpy -c &#39;print(__graalpython__.home)&#39;) &quot;${GRAALPY_HOME}/libexec/graalpy-polyglot-get&quot; -a python -o lib -v &quot;24.0.0&quot;    In PowerShell:     $GRAALPY_HOME = graalpy -c &quot;print(__graalpython__.home)&quot; &amp;amp; &quot;$GRAALPY_HOME/libexec/graalpy-polyglot-get&quot; -a python -o lib -v &quot;24.0.0&quot;    These commands download all GraalPy dependencies into the lib directory.        Provided that your build system is set up to pick up the JAR files from lib, the GraalPy embedding code below should work if put in an appropriate place in the project to run as the main class.     import org.graalvm.polyglot.*; public class Hello {     public static void main(String[] args) {         try (var context = Context.newBuilder().option(&quot;engine.WarnInterpreterOnly&quot;, &quot;false&quot;).build()) {             System.out.println(context.eval(&quot;python&quot;, &quot;&#39;Hello Python!&#39;&quot;).asString());         }     } }  Related Documentation  Modern Python on the JVM  Embedding Graal languages in Java",

TruffleRuby is the fastest Ruby implementation for many CPU-intensive benchmarks.        Run Ruby code in parallel.          TruffleRuby does not have a global interpreter lock and runs Ruby code in parallel.        Support C extensions.          Many C extensions work out of the box, including database drivers.        Add fast and low-overhead interoperability with languages like Java, JavaScript, Python and WebAssembly.          Provided by GraalVM, see the Polyglot documentation.        Provide new tooling, such as debuggers and monitoring, that works across languages.          Includes a profiler, debugger, VisualVM, and more. See the Tools documentation.        Provide all of the above while maintaining very high compatibility with the standard implementation of Ruby.TruffleRuby Runtime ConfigurationsThere are two main runtime configurations of TruffleRuby, Native and JVM, which have different trade-offs.            Configuration:      Native (--native, default)      JVM (--jvm)                  Time to start TruffleRuby      about as fast as MRI startup      slower              Time to reach peak performance      faster      slower              Peak performance (also considering GC)      good      best              Java host interoperability      needs reflection configuration      just works      To find out which runtime configuration is being used, run ruby --version on the command line,or check the value of RUBY_DESCRIPTION or TruffleRuby.native? in Ruby code.Runtime configurations are further detailed in Deploying TruffleRuby.System CompatibilityTruffleRuby is actively tested on the following systems:  Oracle Linux 7, 8, 9  Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04, 20.04, 22.04 (all LTS)  Fedora 37, 38  Debian 10, 11, 12  macOS 11 (Big Sur)Architectures:  AMD64 (aka x86_64): Supported  AArch64 (aka arm64): Supported on Linux (from 21.2) and on macOS (from 22.2)You may find that TruffleRuby will not work if you severely restrict theenvironment, for example, by unmounting system filesystems such as /dev/shm.Dependencies  make and gcc for building C and C++ extensions  libssl for the openssl C extension  libyaml for the psych C extension  zlib for the zlib C extensionWithout these dependencies, many libraries including RubyGems will not work.TruffleRuby will try to print a nice error message if a dependency is missing, but this can only be done on a best effort basis.You also need to set up a UTF-8 locale if not already done.See the contributor workflow document if you wish to build TruffleRuby from source.Current StatusWe recommend that people trying TruffleRuby on their gems and applications get in touch with us for any help they might need.TruffleRuby runs Rails and is compatible with many gems, including C extensions.TruffleRuby is not 100% compatible with MRI 3.2 yet. Please report any compatibility issues you might find.TruffleRuby passes around 97% of ruby/spec,more than any other alternative Ruby implementation.Regarding performance, TruffleRuby is by farthe fastest Ruby implementation on the yjit-bench benchmark suite which includes railsbench, etc.To achieve this performance TruffleRuby needs a fair amount of warmup, as other advanced JIT compilers do.If you find any performance issue, please see this guide.ReleasesTruffleRuby is released at the same time as GraalVM.TruffleRuby continues to use the release numbering based on the calendar year, for example, 21.x, and 22.x., same as GraalVM prior to 2023.See the release roadmap and the upcoming releases list for the release dates and information about how long releases are supported.GraalVM Community Edition releases are supported at most one year.Longer support is available for Oracle GraalVM.Migration from MRITruffleRuby should in most cases work as a drop-in replacement for MRI, but youshould read about our compatibility.Migration from JRubyFor many use cases TruffleRuby should work as a drop-in replacement for JRuby.However, our approach to integration with Java is different to JRuby so youshould read our migration guide.ContactThe best way to get in touch with us is to join the #truffleruby channel onGraalVM Slack.You can also Tweet to @TruffleRuby, or emailbenoit.daloze@oracle.com.Please report security vulnerabilities via the process outlined in the reporting vulnerabilities guide, rather than by something public such as a GitHub issue or a Gitter conversation.Mailing ListAnnouncements about GraalVM, including TruffleRuby, are made on thegraal-dev mailing list.AuthorsThe main authors of TruffleRuby ordered by first contribution are:Chris Seaton, Benoit Daloze, Kevin Menard, Petr Chalupa, Brandon Fish, Duncan MacGregor, Christian Wirth, Rafael França, Alan Wu, Nicolas Laurent, Carol Chen, Nikolay Sverchkov, Lillian Zhang, Tom Stuart, and Maple Ong.SecuritySee SECURITY for how to report security vulnerabilities to Oracle.For known vulnerabilities in Ruby, please refer to the known-cves file.LicenceTruffleRuby is copyright (c) 2013-2024 Oracle and/or its affiliates, and is madeavailable to you under the terms of any one of the following three licenses:  Eclipse Public License version 2.0, or  GNU General Public License version 2, or  GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1.For further licensing information, see LICENCE, 3rd_party_licenses, and doc/legal/legal.AttributionTruffleRuby includes infrastructure code from JRuby (e.g. parser, JCodings, Joni), core library code from the Rubinius project, as well as code from the standard implementation of Ruby, MRI.",

          "title": "GraalVM Insight",
          "content": "GraalVM Insight  Get Started  Polyglot Tracing  Inspecting Values  What to Read NextGraalVM Insight is a multipurpose, flexible tool that traces program runtime behavior and gathers insights.The dynamic nature of the tool helps users to selectively apply tracing pointcuts on already running applications with no loss of performance.GraalVM Insight also provides detailed access to runtime behavior of a program, allowing users to inspect values and types at invocation or allocation sites.The tool further permits users to modify computed values, interrupt execution, and quickly experiment with behavioral changes without modifying the application code.The implementation details of the tool can be found in the API specification.This page provides information on GraalVM Insight as of the 20.1 version.To learn about Insight on versions 20.0 and 19.3, proceed here.Get Started  Create a simple source-tracing.js script with the following content:    insight.on(&#39;source&#39;, function(ev) { if (ev.characters) {     print(`Loading ${ev.characters.length} characters from ${ev.name}`); }});    Having installed the Node.js runtime, start the node launcher with the --insight tool and observe what scripts are being loaded and evaluated:    ./bin/node --insight=source-tracing.js --js.print --experimental-options -e &quot;print(&#39;The result: &#39; + 6 * 7)&quot; | tail -n 10Loading 215 characters from internal/modules/esm/transform_source.jsLoading 12107 characters from internal/modules/esm/translators.jsLoading 1756 characters from internal/modules/esm/create_dynamic_module.jsLoading 12930 characters from internal/vm/module.jsLoading 2710 characters from internal/modules/run_main.jsLoading 308 characters from module.jsLoading 10844 characters from internal/source_map/source_map.jsLoading 170 characters from [eval]-wrapperLoading 29 characters from [eval]The result: 42    The source-tracing.js script used the provided insight object to attach a source listener to the runtime.Whenever the script was loaded, the listener got notified of it and could take an action – printing the length and name of the processed script.  The Insight information can be collected to a print statement or a histogram.The following function-hotness-tracing.js script counts all method invocations and dumps the most frequent ones when the execution of a program is over:var map = new Map();function dumpHotness() {    print(&quot;==== Hotness Top 10 ====&quot;);    var count = 10;    var digits = 3;    Array.from(map.entries()).sort((one, two) =&amp;gt; two[1] - one[1]).forEach(function (entry) {        var number = entry[1].toString();        if (number.length &amp;gt;= digits) {            digits = number.length;        } else {            number = Array(digits - number.length + 1).join(&#39; &#39;) + number;        }        if (count-- &amp;gt; 0) print(`${number} calls to ${entry[0]}`);    });    print(&quot;========================&quot;);}insight.on(&#39;enter&#39;, function(ev) {    var cnt = map.get(ev.name);    if (cnt) {        cnt = cnt + 1;    } else {        cnt = 1;    }    map.set(ev.name, cnt);}, {    roots: true});insight.on(&#39;close&#39;, dumpHotness);The map is a global variable shared inside of the Insight script that allows the code to share data between the insight.on(&#39;enter&#39;) function and the dumpHotnessfunction.The latter is executed when the node process execution is over (registered via insight.on(&#39;close&#39;, dumpHotness).A table with names and counts of function invocations is printed out when the node process exits.Invoke it as:./bin/node --insight=function-hotness-tracing.js --js.print --experimental-options -e &quot;print(&#39;The result: &#39; + 6 * 7)&quot;The result: 42==== Hotness Top 10 ====516 calls to isPosixPathSeparator311 calls to :=&amp;gt;269 calls to E263 calls to makeNodeErrorWithCode159 calls to :anonymous157 calls to :program 58 calls to getOptionValue 58 calls to getCLIOptionsFromBinding 48 calls to validateString 43 calls to hideStackFrames========================Polyglot TracingThe previous examples were written in JavaScript, but due to GraalVM’s polyglot nature, you can take the same instrument and use it in a program written in, e.g., the Ruby language.  Create the source-trace.js file:    insight.on(&#39;source&#39;, function(ev) {if (ev.uri.indexOf(&#39;gems&#39;) === -1) {  let n = ev.uri.substring(ev.uri.lastIndexOf(&#39;/&#39;) + 1);  print(&#39;JavaScript instrument observed load of &#39; + n);}});    Prepare the helloworld.rb Ruby file:    puts &#39;Hello from GraalVM Ruby!&#39;    Apply the JavaScript instrument to the Ruby program:    ./bin/ruby --polyglot --insight=source-trace.js helloworld.rbJavaScript instrument observed load of helloworld.rbHello from GraalVM Ruby!    It is necessary to start the Ruby launcher with the --polyglot parameter, as the source-tracing.js script remains written in JavaScript.  A user can instrument any language on top of GraalVM, but also the Insight scripts can be written in any of the GraalVM supported languages (implemented with the Truffle language implementation framework).  Create the source-tracing.rb Ruby file:    puts &quot;Ruby: Initializing GraalVM Insight script&quot;insight.on(&#39;source&#39;, -&amp;gt;(ev) { name = ev[:name] puts &quot;Ruby: observed loading of #{name}&quot;})puts &#39;Ruby: Hooks are ready!&#39;    Launch a Node.js application and instrument it with the Ruby script:    ./bin/node --polyglot --insight=source-tracing.rb -e &quot;console.log(&#39;With Ruby: &#39; + 6 * 7)&quot; | grep RubyRuby: Initializing GraalVM Insight scriptRuby: Hooks are ready!Ruby: observed loading of internal/per_context/primordials.jsRuby: observed loading of internal/per_context/setup.jsRuby: observed loading of internal/per_context/domexception.js....Ruby: observed loading of internal/modules/cjs/loader.jsRuby: observed loading of vm.jsRuby: observed loading of fs.jsRuby: observed loading of internal/fs/utils.jsRuby: observed loading of [eval]-wrapperRuby: observed loading of [eval]With Ruby: 42  Inspecting ValuesGraalVM Insight not only allows one to trace where the program execution is happening, it also offers access to values of local variables and function arguments during program execution.You can, for example, write an instrument that shows the value of argument n in the function fib:insight.on(&#39;enter&#39;, function(ctx, frame) {   print(&#39;fib for &#39; + frame.n);}, {   roots: true,   rootNameFilter: (name) =&amp;gt; &#39;fib&#39; === name});This instrument uses the second function argument, frame, to get access to values of local variables inside every instrumented function.The above script also uses rootNameFilter to apply its hook only to the function named fib:function fib(n) {  if (n &amp;lt; 1) return 0;  if (n &amp;lt; 2) return 1;  else return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);}print(&quot;Two is the result &quot; + fib(3));When the instrument is stored in a fib-trace.js file and the actual code is in fib.js, invoking the following command yields detailed information about the program execution and parameters passed between function invocations:./bin/node --insight=fib-trace.js --js.print --experimental-options fib.jsfib for 3fib for 2fib for 1fib for 0fib for 1Two is the result 2What to Read NextInsight Deep DiveAny moderately skilled developer can easily create own so called “hooks” and dynamically apply them to the actual programs.That provides ultimate insights into execution and behavior of one’s application without compromising the execution speed.To continue learning and deep dive into GraalVM Insight, proceed to the Insight Manual which starts with an obligatory HelloWorld example and then demonstrates more challenging tasks.Embeddeding GraalVM Insight into ApplicationsGraalVM languages (languages implemented with the Truffle framework) can be embedded into custom applications via Polyglot Context API.GraalVM Insight can also be controlled via the same API.Read the embedding documentation to learn how to integrate GraalVM Insight capabilities into applications in a secure way.Tracing with GraalVM InsightGraalVM Insight dynamically adds tracing capabilities into existing code.Write your application as normally and apply Open Telemetry traces dynamicall when needed.Read more about Insight and Jaeger integration in a dedicated guide.API SpecificationIf you are interested in the implementation details, check the API specification.There you will find the information on the insight object properties, functions, etc.",

          "content": "Truffle Language Implementation FrameworkThe Truffle language implementation framework (Truffle) is an open source library for building tools and programming languages implementations as interpreters for self-modifying Abstract Syntax Trees.Together with the open source Graal compiler, Truffle represents a significant step forward in programming language implementation technology in the current era of dynamic languages.The Truffle bits are uploaded to Maven central. You can use them from your pom.xml file as:&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.truffle&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;truffle-api&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;22.1.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt; &amp;lt;!-- or any later version --&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.truffle&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;truffle-dsl-processor&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;22.1.0&amp;lt;&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;scope&amp;gt;provided&amp;lt;/scope&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;Implement Your LanguageThe Truffle framework allows you to run programming languages efficiently on GraalVM.It simplifies language implementation by automatically deriving high-performance code from interpreters.Getting StartedInformation on how to get starting building your language can be found in the Language Implementation Tutorial.The reference API documentation is available as part of the Truffle Javadoc.Start with looking at the TruffleLanguage class, which one should subclass to start developing a language.Truffle comes prebuilt with the Graal Compiler and several language implementations as part of GraalVM.A good way to start implementing your language with Truffle is to fork the SimpleLanguage project and start hacking.SimpleLanguage is a relatively small language implementation, well-documented, and designed to demonstrate most of the Truffle features.You could also try by looking at code in one of the existing open source languages implementations and experiments.Consider reading these publications for a very detailed view into how many of the aspects of Truffle work. However, as with any other software project, the source code is the ground truth.Advanced TopicsImplementing a language using Truffle offers a way to interoperate with other “Truffle” languages.To learn more about verifying that your language is a valid polyglot citizen, read more about using the Polyglot TCK.Somewhat related topics worth exploring are Truffle Libraries, as well as how to use them to implement a language interoperability.Languages implemented with Truffle can also be embedded in Java host applications using the Polyglot API.To better understand how to improve the performance of your language please consult the documentation on profiling and optimizing your language.Also, to better understand how to use Truffle’s automated monomorphization feature (i.e., splitting), look at the related documentation.Implement Your ToolGraalVM provides a framework for creating language-agnostic tools like debuggers, profilers, and other instrumentations.In general, GraalVM provides a standardized way to express and run program code enabling cross-language research and the development of tools that can be developed once and then applied to any language.The reference API documentation is available as part of the Truffle Javadoc.Start with looking at the TruffleInstrument class, which – similar to TruffleLanguage – one should subclass to start developing a tool.If you want to implement your own “Truffle” tool, a good way to start is to fork the SimpleTool project – like the SimpleLanguage project described above – and start hacking.SimpleTool is a well-documented, minimalistic code-coverage tool designed to be a starting point for understanding the tool development process using Truffle.Since tools, developed with Truffle, instrument the language using the same AST-node-based approach, most of the techniques available to language developers in terms of improving performance are available to the tool developers as well.This is why it is recommended that you understand how Truffle works from a language developer’s perspective, in order to get the maximum out of your tool.CompatibilityThe Truffle API is evolved in a backwards-compatible manner from one version to the next.When an API is deprecated, then it will stay deprecated for at least two GraalVM releases, and a minimum of one month, before it will be removed.As a best practice it is recommended to upgrade Truffle only one version at a time.This way you can increment the version and fix deprecation warnings before continuing to the next version.The deprecated Javadoc tags on the deprecated APIs are designed to be a guide on how to upgrade.The latest additions and changes can be seen in the changelog.Modifying TruffleTo understand how to modify Truffle, consult this file, and if you would like to contribute to Truffle, consult the contribution documentation.",

          "title": "Reachability Metadata",
          "content": "Reachability MetadataThe dynamic language features of the JVM (including reflection and resource handling) compute the dynamically-accessed program elements such as invoked methods or resource URLs at runtime. The native-image tool performs static analysis while building a native binary to determine those dynamic features, but it cannot always exhaustively predict all uses.To ensure inclusion of these elements into the native binary, you should provide reachability metadata (in further text referred as metadata) to the native-image builder. Providing the builder with reachability metadata also ensures seamless compatibility with third-party libraries at runtime.Metadata can be provided to the native-image builder in following ways:  By computing metadata in code when the native binary is built and storing required elements into the initial heap of the native binary.  By providing JSON files stored in the META-INF/native-image/&amp;lt;group.id&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;artifact.id&amp;gt; project directory. For more information about how to collect metadata for your application automatically, see Collecting Metadata Automatically.Table of Contents  Computing Metadata in Code  Specifying Metadata with JSON  Metadata Types  Reflection  Java Native Interface  Resources and Resource Bundles  Dynamic Proxy  Serialization  Predefined ClassesComputing Metadata in CodeComputing metadata in code can be achieved in two ways:      By providing constant arguments to functions that dynamically access elements of the JVM. A good example of such a function is the Class.forName method. In the following code:     class ReflectiveAccess {     public Class&amp;lt;Foo&amp;gt; fetchFoo() throws ClassNotFoundException {         return Class.forName(&quot;Foo&quot;);     } }    the Class.forName(&quot;Foo&quot;) will be computed into a constant when native binary is built and stored in its initial heap.  If the class Foo does not exist, the call will be transformed into throw ClassNotFoundException(&quot;Foo&quot;).        By initializing classes at build time and storing dynamically accessed elements into the initial heap of the native executable. For example:     class InitializedAtBuildTime {     private static Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; aClass;     static {         try {             aClass = Class.forName(readFile(&quot;class.txt&quot;));         } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {             throw RuntimeException(e);         }     }     public Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; fetchClass() {         return aClass;     } }  When metadata is computed in code, the dynamically accessed elements will be included into the native executable’s heap only if that part of the heap is reachable through an enclosing method (for example, ReflectiveAccess#fetchFoo) or a static field (for example, InitializedAtBuildTime.aClass).Specifying Metadata with JSONEach dynamic Java feature that requires metadata has a corresponding JSON file named &amp;lt;feature&amp;gt;-config.json.The JSON file consists of entries that tell Native Image the elements to include.For example, Java reflection metadata is specified in reflect-config.json, and a sample entry looks like:{  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Foo&quot;}Each entry in json-based metadata should be conditional to avoid unnecessary growth in the size of the native binary.A condition is specified in the following way:{  &quot;condition&quot;: {    &quot;typeReachable&quot;: &quot;&amp;lt;fully-qualified-class-name&amp;gt;&quot;  },  &amp;lt;metadata-entry&amp;gt;}An entry with a typeReachable condition is considered only when the fully-qualified class is reachable.Currently, we support only typeReachable as a condition.Find more examples of the configuration files in the GraalVM Reachability Metadata repository.Metadata TypesNative Image accepts the following types of reachability metadata:  Java reflection (the java.lang.reflect.* API) enables Java code to examine its own classes, methods, fields, and their properties at run time.  JNI allows native code to access classes, methods, fields and their properties at run time.  Resources and Resource Bundles allow arbitrary files present in the application to be loaded.  Dynamic JDK Proxies create classes on demand that implement a given list of interfaces.  Serialization enables writing and reading Java objects to and from streams.  Predefined Classes provide support for dynamically generated classes.ReflectionComputing Reflection Metadata in CodeSome reflection methods are treated specially and are evaluated at build time when given constant arguments.These methods, in each of the listed classes, are:  java.lang.Class: getField, getMethod, getConstructor, getDeclaredField, getDeclaredMethod, getDeclaredConstructor, forName, getClassLoader  java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles: publicLookup, privateLookupIn, arrayConstructor, arrayLength, arrayElementGetter, arrayElementSetter, arrayElementVarHandle, byteArrayViewVarHandle, byteBufferViewVarHandle, lookup  java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup: in , findStatic , findVirtual , findConstructor , findClass , accessClass , findSpecial , findGetter , findSetter , findVarHandle , findStaticGetter , findStaticSetter , findStaticVarHandle , unreflect , unreflectSpecial , unreflectConstructor , unreflectGetter , unreflectSetter , unreflectVarHandle  java.lang.invoke.MethodType: methodType, genericMethodType, changeParameterType, insertParameterTypes, appendParameterTypes, replaceParameterTypes, dropParameterTypes, changeReturnType, erase, generic, wrap, unwrap, parameterType, parameterCount, returnType, lastParameterTypeBelow are examples of calls that are replaced with the corresponding metadata element:Class.forName(&quot;java.lang.Integer&quot;)Class.forName(&quot;java.lang.Integer&quot;, true, ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader())Class.forName(&quot;java.lang.Integer&quot;).getMethod(&quot;equals&quot;, Object.class)Integer.class.getDeclaredMethod(&quot;bitCount&quot;, int.class)Integer.class.getConstructor(String.class)Integer.class.getDeclaredConstructor(int.class)Integer.class.getField(&quot;MAX_VALUE&quot;)Integer.class.getDeclaredField(&quot;value&quot;)When passing constant arrays, the following approaches to declare and populate an array are equivalent from the point of view of the native-image builder:Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] params0 = new Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[]{String.class, int.class};Integer.class.getMethod(&quot;parseInt&quot;, params0);Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] params1 = new Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[2];params1[0] = Class.forName(&quot;java.lang.String&quot;);params1[1] = int.class;Integer.class.getMethod(&quot;parseInt&quot;, params1);Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] params2 = {String.class, int.class};Integer.class.getMethod(&quot;parseInt&quot;, params2);Specifying Reflection Metadata in JSONReflection metadata should be specified in a reflect-config.json file and conform to the JSON schema defined in reflect-config-schema-v1.0.0.json.The schema also includes further details and explanations how this configuration works. Here is the example of the reflect-config.json:[    {        &quot;condition&quot;: {            &quot;typeReachable&quot;: &quot;&amp;lt;condition-class&amp;gt;&quot;        },        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;&amp;lt;class&amp;gt;&quot;,        &quot;methods&quot;: [            {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;&amp;lt;methodName&amp;gt;&quot;, &quot;parameterTypes&quot;: [&quot;&amp;lt;param-one-type&amp;gt;&quot;]}        ],        &quot;queriedMethods&quot;: [            {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;&amp;lt;methodName&amp;gt;&quot;, &quot;parameterTypes&quot;: [&quot;&amp;lt;param-one-type&amp;gt;&quot;]}        ],        &quot;fields&quot;: [            {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;&amp;lt;fieldName&amp;gt;&quot;}        ],        &quot;allDeclaredClasses&quot;: true,        &quot;allDeclaredMethods&quot;: true,        &quot;allDeclaredFields&quot;: true,         &quot;allDeclaredConstructors&quot;: true,        &quot;allPublicClasses&quot;: true,        &quot;allPublicMethods&quot;: true,        &quot;allPublicFields&quot;: true,        &quot;allPublicConstructors&quot;: true,        &quot;allRecordComponents&quot;: true,        &quot;allNestMembers&quot;: true,        &quot;allSigners&quot;: true,        &quot;allPermittedSubclasses&quot;: true,        &quot;queryAllDeclaredMethods&quot;: true,        &quot;queryAllDeclaredConstructors&quot;: true,        &quot;queryAllPublicMethods&quot;: true,        &quot;queryAllPublicConstructors&quot;: true,        &quot;unsafeAllocated&quot;: true    }]Java Native InterfaceJava Native Interface (JNI) allows native code to access arbitrary Java types and type members.Native Image cannot predict what such native code will lookup, write to or invoke.To build a native binary for a Java application that uses JNI, JNI metadata is most likely required.For example, the given C code:jclass clazz = FindClass(env, &quot;java/lang/String&quot;);looks up the java.lang.String class, which can then be used, for example, to invoke different String methods.The generated metadata entry for the above call would look like:{  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;java.lang.String&quot;}JNI Metadata In CodeIt is not possible to specify JNI metadata in code.JNI Metadata in JSONJNI metadata should be specified in a jni-config.json file and conform to the JSON schema defined injni-config-schema-v1.0.0.json.The schema also includes further details and explanations how this configuration works. The example of jni-config.json is the sameas the example of reflect-config.json described above.Resources and Resource BundlesJava is capable of accessing any resource on the application class path, or the module path for which the requesting code has permission to access.Resource metadata instructs the native-image builder to include specified resources and resource bundles in the produced binary.A consequence of this approach is that some parts of the application that use resources for configuration (such as logging) are effectively configured at build time.Resource Metadata In CodeNative Image will detect calls to java.lang.Class#getResource and java.lang.Class#getResourceAsStream in which:  The class on which these methods are called is constant  The first parameter, name, is a constantand automatically register such resources.The code below will work out of the box, because:  We are using a class literal (Example.class)  We are using a string literal as the name parameter    class Example { public void conquerTheWorld() {     ...     InputStream plan = Example.class.getResourceAsStream(&quot;plans/v2/conquer_the_world.txt&quot;);     ... }}  Resource Metadata in JSONResource metadata should be specified in a resource-config.json file and conform to the JSON schema defined inresource-config-schema-v1.0.0.json.The schema also includes further details and explanations how this configuration works. Here is the example of the resource-config.json:{  &quot;resources&quot;: {    &quot;includes&quot;: [      {        &quot;condition&quot;: {          &quot;typeReachable&quot;: &quot;&amp;lt;condition-class&amp;gt;&quot;        },        &quot;pattern&quot;: &quot;.*.txt&quot;      }    ],    &quot;excludes&quot;: [      {        &quot;condition&quot;: {          &quot;typeReachable&quot;: &quot;&amp;lt;condition-class&amp;gt;&quot;        },        &quot;pattern&quot;: &quot;.*.txt&quot;      }    ]  },  &quot;bundles&quot;: [    {      &quot;condition&quot;: {        &quot;typeReachable&quot;: &quot;&amp;lt;condition-class&amp;gt;&quot;      },      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;fully.qualified.bundle.name&quot;,      &quot;locales&quot;: [&quot;en&quot;, &quot;de&quot;, &quot;sk&quot;]    },    {      &quot;condition&quot;: {        &quot;typeReachable&quot;: &quot;&amp;lt;condition-class&amp;gt;&quot;      },      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;fully.qualified.bundle.name&quot;,      &quot;classNames&quot;: [        &quot;fully.qualified.bundle.name_en&quot;,        &quot;fully.qualified.bundle.name_de&quot;      ]    }  ]}Dynamic ProxyThe JDK supports generating proxy classes for a given interface list.Native Image does not support generating new classes at runtime and requires metadata to properly run code that uses these proxies.  Note: The order of interfaces in the interface list used to create a proxy matters. Creating a proxy with two identical interface lists in which the interfaces are not in the same order, creates two distinct proxy classes.Code ExampleThe following code creates two distinct proxies:import java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler;import java.lang.reflect.Proxy;interface IA {}interface IB {}class Example {    public void doWork() {        InvocationHandler handler;        ...        Object proxyOne = Proxy.newProxyInstance(Example.class.getClassLoader(), new Class[]{IA.class, IB.class}, handler);        Object proxyTwo = Proxy.newProxyInstance(Example.class.getClassLoader(), new Class[]{IB.class, IA.class}, handler);        ...    }}Dynamic Proxy Metadata In CodeThe following methods are evaluated at build time when called with constant arguments:  java.lang.reflect.Proxy.getProxyClass  java.lang.reflect.Proxy.newProxyInstanceDynamic Proxy Metadata in JSONDynamic proxy metadata should be specified in a proxy-config.json file and conform to the JSON schema defined inproxy-config-schema-v1.0.0.json.The schema also includes further details and explanations how this configuration works. Here is the example of the proxy-config.json:[  {    &quot;condition&quot;: {      &quot;typeReachable&quot;: &quot;&amp;lt;condition-class&amp;gt;&quot;    },    &quot;interfaces&quot;: [      &quot;IA&quot;,      &quot;IB&quot;    ]  }]SerializationJava can serialize any class that implements the Serializable interface.Native Image supports serialization with proper serializaiton metadata registration. This is necessary as serialization usuallyrequires reflectively accessing the class of the object that is being serialized.Serialization Metadata Registration In CodeNative Image detects calls to ObjectInputFilter.Config#createFilter(String pattern) and if the pattern argument is constant, the exact classes mentioned in the pattern will be registered for serialization. For example, the following pattern will register the class pkg.SerializableClass for serialization:  var filter = ObjectInputFilter.Config.createFilter(&quot;pkg.SerializableClass;!*;&quot;)  objectInputStream.setObjectInputFilter(proof);Using this pattern has a positive side effect of improving security on the JVM as only pkg.SerializableClass can be received by the objectInputStream.Wildcard patterns do the serialization registration only for lambda-proxy classes of an enclosing class. For example, to register lambda serialization in an enclosing class pkg.LambdaHolder use:  ObjectInputFilter.Config.createFilter(&quot;pkg.LambdaHolder$$Lambda*;&quot;)Patterns like &quot;pkg.**&quot; and &quot;pkg.Prefix*&quot; will not perform serialization registration as they are too general and would increase image size significantly.For calls to the sun.reflect.ReflectionFactory#newConstructorForSerialization(java.lang.Class) and sun.reflect.ReflectionFactory#newConstructorForSerialization(java.lang.Class, ) native image detects calls to these functions when all arguments and the receiver are constant. For example, the following call will register SerializlableClass for serialization:  ReflectionFactory.getReflectionFactory().newConstructorForSerialization(SerializableClass.class);To create a custom constructor for serialization use:  var constructor = SuperSuperClass.class.getDeclaredConstructor();  var newConstructor = ReflectionFactory.getReflectionFactory().newConstructorForSerialization(BaseClass.class, constructor);Proxy classes can only be registered for serialization via the JSON files.Serialization Metadata in JSONSerialization metadata should be specified in a serialization-config.json file and conform to the JSON schema defined inserialization-config-schema-v1.0.0.json.The schema also includes further details and explanations how this configuration works. Here is the example of the serialization-config.json:{  &quot;types&quot;: [    {      &quot;condition&quot;: {        &quot;typeReachable&quot;: &quot;&amp;lt;condition-class&amp;gt;&quot;      },      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;&amp;lt;fully-qualified-class-name&amp;gt;&quot;,      &quot;customTargetConstructorClass&quot;: &quot;&amp;lt;custom-target-constructor-class&amp;gt;&quot;    }  ],  &quot;lambdaCapturingTypes&quot;: [    {      &quot;condition&quot;: {        &quot;typeReachable&quot;: &quot;&amp;lt;condition-class&amp;gt;&quot;      },      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;&amp;lt;fully-qualified-class-name&amp;gt;&quot;    }  ], &quot;proxies&quot;: [   {     &quot;condition&quot;: {       &quot;typeReachable&quot;: &quot;&amp;lt;condition-class&amp;gt;&quot;     },     &quot;interfaces&quot;: [&quot;&amp;lt;fully-qualified-interface-name-1&amp;gt;&quot;, &quot;&amp;lt;fully-qualified-interface-name-n&amp;gt;&quot;]   } ]}Predefined ClassesNative Image requires all classes to be known at build time (a “closed-world assumption”).However, Java has support for loading new classes at runtime.To emulate class loading, the agent can trace dynamically loaded classes and save their bytecode for later use by the native-image builder.At runtime, if there is an attempt to load a class with the same name and bytecodes as one of the classes encountered during tracing, the predefined class will be supplied to the application.  Note: Predefined classes metadata is not meant to be manually written.Predefined Classes Metadata In CodeIt is not possible to specify predefined classes in code.Predefined Classes Metadata in JSONPredefined classes metadata should be specified in a predefined-classes-config.json file and conform to the JSON schema defined inpredefined-classes-config-schema-v1.0.0.json.The schema also includes further details and explanations how this configuration works. Here is the example of the predefined-classes-config.json:[  {    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;agent-extracted&quot;,    &quot;classes&quot;: [      {        &quot;hash&quot;: &quot;&amp;lt;class-bytecodes-hash&amp;gt;&quot;,        &quot;nameInfo&quot;: &quot;&amp;lt;class-name&quot;      }    ]  }]Strict Metadata ModeNative Image’s strict metadata mode helps ensure the correctness and composability of the Native Image metadata, by strengthening the metadata requirements for reflection queries.This mode can be activated with the -H:ThrowMissingRegistrationErrors= option and requires the following additional registrations over the default:Reflection  If a reflectively-accessed element (Class, Field, Method, etc.) is not present on the image class- or module-path, it still needs to be registered to ensure the correct exception (ClassNotFoundException or similar) is thrown.If an element is queried at run-time without having been registered, regardless of whether it is present on the class- or module-path, this query will throw a MissingReflectionRegistrationError.This change ensures that the error is not ambiguous between a non-existent element and one that was not registered for reflection in the image;  This rationale also requires that any query that returns a collection of class members (Class.getMethods() or similar) has to be registered in full (with &quot;queryAllPublicMethods&quot; in this case) to succeed at run-time.This additionally ensures that any of the registered elements can be queried individually, and non-existent elements of that type will throw the correct exception without having to be registered.However, this means that Class.getMethods() does not return the subset of methods that were registered, but throws a MissingReflectionRegistrationError if &quot;queryAllPublicMethods&quot; is missing.Resources  If a resource or resource bundle is not present on the image class- or module-path, it still needs to be registered to ensure the correct return value (null).If a resource is queried at run-time without having been registered, regardless of whether it is present on the class- or module-path, this query will throw a MissingResourceRegistrationError.This change ensures that the program behavior is not ambiguous between a non-existent resource and one that was not registered for run-time access;The Native Image agent does not support custom implementations of ResourceBundle$Control or Bundles$Strategy and requires manual registrations for the reflection and resource queries that they will perform.Transition toolsThis mode will be made the default behavior of Native Image in a future release. We encourage you to start transitioning your code as soon as possible.The Native Image agent outputs JSON files that conform to both the default and strict modes of operation.The following options are useful for debugging issues during the transition to the strict mode:  -H:ThrowMissingRegistrationErrors=&amp;lt;package list&amp;gt;: limits MissingReflectionRegistrationError to be thrown from a defined list of packages.This is useful when using some library code that has not been ported to the new mode yet;  -H:MissingRegistrationReportingMode: sets how MissingReflectionRegistrationError is reported:          Throw is the default. The error is simply thrown as a Java exception;      Warn outputs a small stack trace for every error encountered, which results in a report of all the places the tested code is going to throw when the strict mode is enabled;      Exit exits the program when encountering the error. This is useful to detect blanket catch (Throwable t) { blocks that would otherwise silence the error.

          "content": "Reflection in Native ImageJava reflection support (the java.lang.reflect.* API) enables Java code to examine its own classes, methods, fields and their properties at run time.(Note: loading classes with Class.forName(String) are included here since it is closely related to reflection.)Native Image fully supports reflection in ahead-of-time compiled images.It may require additional configuration when reflection is used in ways that are unpredictable for the static analysis (e.g., depending on user input).Examining and accessing program elements through java.lang.reflect.* or loading classes with Class.forName(String) at run time can require preparing additional metadata for those program elements in the image.This metadata must be stored in the image already when it is created ahead of time.To reduce both the overall file size of images and the overhead of maintaining configuration, it is nonetheless recommended to avoid the use of reflection when possible.Native Image tries to resolve the target elements through a static analysis that detects calls to the Reflection API.Where the analysis fails, the program elements reflectively accessed at run time must be specified using a manual configuration.See Reachability Metadata for more details on this configuration.Note that you can Collect Metadata with the Tracing Agent.Using this manual or agent-provided configuration the image builder can include the required metadata in the created image, allowing reflective accesses during image runtime.Table of Contents  Automatic Detection  Manual Configuration  Conditional Configuration  Configuration with FeaturesAutomatic DetectionThe analysis intercepts calls to Class.forName(String), Class.forName(String, ClassLoader), Class.getDeclaredField(String), Class.getField(String), Class.getDeclaredMethod(String, Class[]), Class.getMethod(String, Class[]), Class.getDeclaredConstructor(Class[]), and Class.getConstructor(Class[]).If the arguments to these calls can be reduced to a constant, Native Image tries to resolve the target elements.If the target elements can be resolved, the calls are removed and instead the target elements are embedded in the code.If the target elements cannot be resolved, e.g., a class is not on the classpath or it does not declare a field/method/constructor, then the calls are replaced with a snippet that throws the appropriate exception at run time.The benefits are twofold.First, at run time there are no calls to the Reflection API.Second, GraalVM can employ constant folding and optimize the code further.The calls are intercepted and processed only when it can be unequivocally determined that the parameters can be reduced to a constant.For example, the call Class.forName(String) will be replaced with a Class literal only if the String argument can be constant folded, assuming that the class is actually on the classpath.Additionally, a call to Class.getMethod(String, Class[]) will be processed only if the contents of the Class[] argument can be determined with certainty.This last restriction is due to the fact that Java does not have immutable arrays.Therefore, all the changes to the array between the time it is allocated and the time it is passed as an argument need to be tracked.The analysis follows a simple rule: if all the writes to the array happen in linear sections of code, i.e., no control flow splits, then the array is effectively constant for the purpose of analyzing the call.That is why the analysis does not accept Class[] arguments coming from static fields, since the contents of those can change at any time, even if the fields are final.Although this may seem too restrictive, it covers the most commonly used patterns of the Reflection API calls.The only exception to the constant arguments rule is that the ClassLoader argument of Class.forName(String, ClassLoader) does not need to be a constant; it is ignored and instead a class loader that can load all the classes on the class path is used.The analysis runs to a fix point which means that a chain of calls like Class.forName(String).getMethod(String, Class[]) will first replace the class constant and then the method will effectively reduce this to java.lang.reflect.Method.Following are examples of calls that can be intercepted and replaced with the corresponding element:Class.forName(&quot;java.lang.Integer&quot;)Class.forName(&quot;java.lang.Integer&quot;, true, ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader())Class.forName(&quot;java.lang.Integer&quot;).getMethod(&quot;equals&quot;, Object.class)Integer.class.getDeclaredMethod(&quot;bitCount&quot;, int.class)Integer.class.getConstructor(String.class)Integer.class.getDeclaredConstructor(int.class)Integer.class.getField(&quot;MAX_VALUE&quot;)Integer.class.getDeclaredField(&quot;value&quot;)The following ways to declare and populate an array are equivalent from the point of view of the analysis:Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] params0 = new Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[]{String.class, int.class};Integer.class.getMethod(&quot;parseInt&quot;, params0);Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] params1 = new Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[2];params1[0] = Class.forName(&quot;java.lang.String&quot;);params1[1] = int.class;Integer.class.getMethod(&quot;parseInt&quot;, params1);Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] params2 = {String.class, int.class};Integer.class.getMethod(&quot;parseInt&quot;, params2);If a call cannot be processed it is simply skipped.For these situations a manual configuration as described below can be provided.Manual ConfigurationA configuration that specifies the program elements that will be accessed reflectively can be provided as follows:-H:ReflectionConfigurationFiles=/path/to/reflectconfigHere, reflectconfig is a JSON file in the following format (use --expert-options for more details):[  {    &quot;name&quot; : &quot;java.lang.Class&quot;,    &quot;queryAllDeclaredConstructors&quot; : true,    &quot;queryAllPublicConstructors&quot; : true,    &quot;queryAllDeclaredMethods&quot; : true,    &quot;queryAllPublicMethods&quot; : true,    &quot;allDeclaredClasses&quot; : true,    &quot;allPublicClasses&quot; : true  },  {    &quot;name&quot; : &quot;java.lang.String&quot;,    &quot;fields&quot; : [      { &quot;name&quot; : &quot;value&quot; },      { &quot;name&quot; : &quot;hash&quot; }    ],    &quot;methods&quot; : [      { &quot;name&quot; : &quot;&amp;lt;init&amp;gt;&quot;, &quot;parameterTypes&quot; : [] },      { &quot;name&quot; : &quot;&amp;lt;init&amp;gt;&quot;, &quot;parameterTypes&quot; : [&quot;char[]&quot;] },      { &quot;name&quot; : &quot;charAt&quot; },      { &quot;name&quot; : &quot;format&quot;, &quot;parameterTypes&quot; : [&quot;java.lang.String&quot;, &quot;java.lang.Object[]&quot;] }    ]  },  {    &quot;name&quot; : &quot;java.lang.String$CaseInsensitiveComparator&quot;,    &quot;queriedMethods&quot; : [      { &quot;name&quot; : &quot;compare&quot; }    ]  }]The configuration distinguishes between methods and constructors that can be invoked during execution via Method.invoke(Object, Object...) or Constructor.newInstance(Object...) and those that can not.Including a function in the configuration without invocation capabilities helps the static analysis correctly assess its reachability status and results in smaller binary sizes.The function metadata is then accessible at runtime like it would for any other registered reflection method or constructor, but trying to call the function will result in a runtime error.The configuration fields prefixed by query or queried only include the metadata, while the other ones (e.g., methods) enable runtime invocation.The native image builder generates reflection metadata for all classes, methods, and fields referenced in that file.The queryAllPublicConstructors, queryAllDeclaredConstructors, queryAllPublicMethods, queryAllDeclaredMethods, allPublicConstructors, allDeclaredConstructors, allPublicMethods, allDeclaredMethods, allPublicFields, allDeclaredFields, allPublicClasses, and allDeclaredClasses attributes can be used to automatically include an entire set of members of a class.However, allPublicClasses and allDeclaredClasses do not automatically register the inner classes for reflective access.They just make them available via Class.getClasses() and Class.getDeclaredClasses() when called on the declaring class.Code may also write non-static final fields like String.value in this example, but other code might not observe changes of final field values in the same way as for non-final fields because of optimizations. Static final fields may never be written.More than one configuration can be used by specifying multiple paths for ReflectionConfigurationFiles and separating them with ,.Also, -H:ReflectionConfigurationResources can be specified to load one or several configuration files from the build’s class path, such as from a JAR file.Elements and queries registered by defaultQuerying the methods and constructor of java.lang.Object does not require configuration. The Java access rules still apply.Likewise, when using the strict metadata mode, it is possible to query the public or declared fields, methods and constructors of java.lang.Object, primitive classes and array classes without requiring a configuration entry.These queries return empty arrays in most cases, except for java.lang.Object methods and constructors and array public methods (all inherited from java.lang.Object). The image size impact of this inclusion is therefore minimal.On the other hand, it is necessary to register these methods and constructors if they need to be reflectively invoked at run-time, via Method.invoke() or Constructor.newInstance().Conditional ConfigurationWith conditional configuration, a class configuration entry is applied only if a provided condition is satisfied.The only currently supported condition is typeReachable, which enables the configuration entry if the specified type is reachable through other code.For example, to support reflective access to sun.misc.Unsafe.theUnsafe only when io.netty.util.internal.PlatformDependent0 is reachable, the configuration should look like:{  &quot;condition&quot; : { &quot;typeReachable&quot; : &quot;io.netty.util.internal.PlatformDependent0&quot; },  &quot;name&quot; : &quot;sun.misc.Unsafe&quot;,  &quot;fields&quot; : [    { &quot;name&quot; : &quot;theUnsafe&quot; }  ]}Conditional configuration is the preferred way to specify reflection configuration: if code doing a reflective access is not reachable, it is unnecessary to include its corresponding reflection entry.The consistent usage of condition results in smaller binaries and better build times as the image builder can selectively include reflectively accessed code.If a condition is omitted, the element is always included.When the same condition is used for two distinct elements in two configuration entries, both elements will be included when the condition is satisfied.When a configuration entry should be enabled if one of several types are reachable, it is necessary to add two configuration entries: one entry for each condition.When used with assisted configuration, conditional entries of existing configuration will not be fused with agent-collected entries.Configuration with FeaturesAlternatively, a custom Feature implementation can register program elements before and during the analysis phase of the build using the RuntimeReflection class. For example:class RuntimeReflectionRegistrationFeature implements Feature {  public void beforeAnalysis(BeforeAnalysisAccess access) {    try {      RuntimeReflection.register(String.class);      RuntimeReflection.register(String.class.getDeclaredField(&quot;value&quot;));      RuntimeReflection.register(String.class.getDeclaredField(&quot;hash&quot;));      RuntimeReflection.register(String.class.getDeclaredConstructor(char[].class));      RuntimeReflection.register(String.class.getDeclaredMethod(&quot;charAt&quot;, int.class));      RuntimeReflection.register(String.class.getDeclaredMethod(&quot;format&quot;, String.class, Object[].class));      RuntimeReflection.register(String.CaseInsensitiveComparator.class);      RuntimeReflection.register(String.CaseInsensitiveComparator.class.getDeclaredMethod(&quot;compare&quot;, String.class, String.class));    } catch (NoSuchMethodException | NoSuchFieldException e) { ... }  }}To activate the custom feature --features=&amp;lt;fully qualified name of RuntimeReflectionRegistrationFeature class&amp;gt; needs to be passed to native-image.Native Image Build Configuration explains how this can be automated with a native-image.properties file in META-INF/native-image.Use of Reflection at Build TimeReflection can be used without restrictions during the native binary generation, for example, in static initializers.At this point, code can collect information about methods and fields and store them in their own data structures, which are then reflection-free at run time.Unsafe AccessesThe Unsafe class, although its use is discouraged, provides direct access to the memory of Java objects.The Unsafe.objectFieldOffset() method provides the offset of a field within a Java object.Note that the offsets that are queried at native binary build time can be different from the offsets at run time.Related Documentation  Build a Native Executable with Reflection  Class Initialization in Native Image  Collect Metadata with the Tracing Agent  Reachability Metadata: Reflection",

          "title": "Reporting Polymorphic Specializations to Runtime",
          "content": "Reporting Polymorphic Specializations to RuntimeThis guide gives an overview of what is required of language implementers in order to leverage the monomorphization (splitting) strategy.More information on how it works can be found in the Splitting guide.In simple terms, the monomorphization heuristic relies on the language reporting polymorphic specializations for each node that could potentially be returned to a monomorphic state through splitting.In this context a polymorphic specialization is any node rewriting which results in the node changing “how polymorphic” it is. This includes, but is not limited to, activating another specialization, increasing the number of instances of an active specialization, excluding a specialization, etc..Manual Reporting of Polymorphic SpecializationsTo facilitate reporting of polymorphic specializations, a new API was introducedinto the Node class: Node#reportPolymorphicSpecialize.This method can be used to manually report polymorphic specializations, but only in cases when this cannot be automated by using the DSL.Automated Reporting of Polymorphic SpecializationsSince the Truffle DSL automates much of the transitions between specializations, the @ReportPolymorphism annotation for automated reporting of polymorphic specializations was added.This annotation instructs the DSL to include checks for polymorphism after specializations and to call Node#reportPolymorphicSpecialize if needed.For an example on how to use this annotation, consider the com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.SLStatementNode. It is the base class for allSimpleLanguage nodes and, since the ReportPolymorphism annotation is inherited, simply annotating this class will enable reporting of polymorphic specializations for all SimpleLanguage nodes.Below is the diff of the change that adds this annotation to SLStatementNode:diff

particular nodes and specializationsApplying the ReportPolymorphism annotation to all nodes of a language is the simplest way to facilitate the monomorphization, but it could cause reporting of polymorphic specializations in cases where that does not necessarily make sense.In order to give the language developer more control over which nodes and which specializations are taken into consideration for reporting polymorphism, the @ReportPolymorphism.Exclude annotation was introduced which is applicable to classes (disabling automated reporting for the entire class) or to individual specializations (excluding those specializations from consideration when checking for polymorphism).Reporting only on Megamorphic CasesAs of version 20.3.0 a new annotation was added: ReportPolymorphism.Megamorphic.This annotation can only be applied to specializations, as marks that specialization as megamorphic as it is intented to be used on expensive “generic” specializations that should be fixed by monomorphization.The effect of adding this annotation is that, once the annotated specialisation becomes active, the node will report polymorphism to the runtime independant of the state of other specializations.This annotation can be used separately from @ReportPolymorphism, i.e., a node does not need to be annotated with @ReportPolymorphism for the megamorphic annotation to work.If both annotations are used, then both polymorphic and megamorphic activations will be reported as polymorphism.Tools SupportKnowing which nodes should and should not report polymorphic specializations is for the language developer to conclude.This can be done either through domain knowledge (which nodes of the language are expensive when polymorphic), or through experimentation (measuring the effects of including/excluding particular nodes/specializations).To aid language developers in better understanding the impact of reporting polymorphic specializations some tools support was provided.Tracing individual splitsAdding the --engine.TraceSplitting argument to the command line when executing your guest language code will, in real time, print information about each

option.This option will print, in real time, a log detailing which nodes are reporting polymorphism and how that is affecting the call targets.See the following examples.Example 1[engine] [poly-event]

The &amp;lt;log level&amp;gt; argument must be in the range 1 to 5 (from least detailed to most detailed). A log level of 3 provides brief details of the included resources.Example UsageGiven this project structure:app-root└── src    └── main        └── resources            ├── Resource0.txt            └── Resource1.txtThen:  All resources can be loaded with &quot;.*/Resource.*txt$&quot;, specified as {&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;.*/Resource.*txt$&quot;} in a configuration file, or -H:IncludeResources=&quot;.*/Resource.*txt$&quot; on the command line.  Resource0.txt can be loaded with .*/Resource0.txt$.  Resource0.txt and Resource1.txt can be loaded with .*/Resource0.txt$ and .*/Resource1.txt$ (or alternatively with a single .*/(Resource0|Resource1).txt$).  Also, if we want to include everything except the Resource2.txt file, we can simply exclude it using -H:IncludeResources=&quot;.*/Resource.*txt$&quot; followed by -H:ExcludeResources=&quot;.*/Resource2.txt$&quot;.Check this guide which illustrates how to include a resource into a native executable.LocalesIt is also possible to specify which locales should be included in the executable and which should be the default.For example, to switch the default locale to Swiss German and also include French and English, use the following  options:native-image -Duser.country=CH -Duser.language=de -H:IncludeLocales=fr,enThe locales are specified using language tags. You can include alllocales via -H:+IncludeAllLocales, but note that it increases the size of the resultingexecutable.Resource BundlesJava localization support (java.util.ResourceBundle) enables Java code to load L10N resources and show the user messages suitable for runtime settings such as time, locale, and format.Native Image needs knowledge ahead-of-time of the resource bundles your application needs so that it can load and store the appropriate bundles for usage in the generated executable.The bundles can be specified in the resource configuration file (see above), in the bundles section:{  &quot;bundles&quot;: [    {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;your.pkg.Bundle&quot;},    {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;another.pkg.Resource&quot;},    {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;etc.Bundle&quot;}  ],  &quot;resources&quot;: &amp;lt;see above&amp;gt;}Alternatively, bundles can be specified directly as options to the native-image tool as follows:native-image -H:IncludeResourceBundles=your.pgk.Bundle,another.pkg.Resource,etc.Bundle ...By default, requested bundles are included for all requested locales.To optimize this, it is possible to use IncludeResourceBundles with a locale-specific substring, for example -H:+IncludeResourceBundles=com.company.bundles.MyBundle_fr-FR will only include the bundle in French.Resources in Java ModulesWherever resources are specified with &amp;lt;Java regexp that matches resources to be included in the image&amp;gt; or resource bundles are specified via bundle name, it is possible to specify the exact modules from which these resources or bundles should be taken. To do so, specify the module name before the resource-regex or bundle name with : as the separator. For example:{   &quot;resources&quot;: {      &quot;includes&quot;: [         {            &quot;pattern&quot;: &quot;library-module:^resource-file.txt$&quot;         }      ]   },   &quot;bundles&quot;: [      {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;main-module:your.pkg.Bundle&quot;}   ]}This will cause the native-image tool to only include resource-file.txt from the Java module library-module. If other modules or the classpath contains resources that match the pattern ^resource-file.txt$ only the one in module library-module is registered for inclusion in the executable. Similarly, if other bundles are accessible with the same bundle name your.pkg.Bundle only the one from main-module is included. Native image will also ensure that the modules are guaranteed to be accessible at runtime. That is, the following code pattern:InputStream resource = ModuleLayer.boot().findModule(moduleName).getResourceAsStream(resourcePath);will always work as expected for resources registered as described above (even if the module does not contain any code that is considered reachable by static analysis).Java VM Mode of LocalizationResource Bundle lookup is a complex and dynamic mechanism which utilizes a lot of Java VM infrastructure.As a result, it causes the size of the executable to increase for smaller applications such as HelloWorld.Therefore, an optimized mode is set by default in which this lookup is simplified utilizing the fact that all bundles are known ahead of build time.For the original Java VM lookup, use the -H:-LocalizationOptimizedMode option.Further Reading  Include Resources in a Native Executable  Native Image Build Configuration",

          "content": "Run GraalVM JavaScript on a Stock JDKGraalVM JavaScript is optimized for execution as part of GraalVM, or in an embedding scenario built on GraalVM.This guarantees best possible performance by using the GraalVM compiler as the optimizing compiler, and potentially Native Image to ahead-of-time compile the engine into a native binary.As GraalVM JavaScript is a Java application, it is possible to execute it on a stock Java VM like OpenJDK.When executed without the Graal Compiler, JavaScript performance will be significantly worse.While the JIT compilers available on stock JVMs can execute and JIT-compile the GraalVM JavaScript codebase, they cannot optimize it to its full performance potential.This document describes how to run GraalVM JavaScript on stock Java VMs, and shows how you can use the GraalVM compiler as a JIT compiler to guarantee the best possible performance.GraalVM JavaScript on Maven CentralGraalVM JavaScript is open source and regularly pushed to Maven Central Repository by the community.You can find it as a POM artifact, under org.graalvm.polyglot:js.There are example Maven projects for GraalVM JavaScript on JDK 21 (or later) using the Graal compiler:  Polyglot Embedding Demo.Example Maven and Gradle projects for a simple JavaScript “Hello World” application.  JS Maven Demo.This example contains a Maven project for a JavaScript benchmark (a prime number generator).It allows a user to compare the performance of GraalVM JavaScript running with or without the GraalVM compiler as the optimizing compiler.Running with the GraalVM compiler will significantly improve the execution performance of any relatively large JavaScript codebase.In essence, the example pom.xml file activates the JVM Compiler Interface (JVMCI) and configures the JIT compiler to be the Graal compiler by providing it on --module-path and --upgrade-module-path.ScriptEngine JSR 223GraalVM JavaScript can be started via ScriptEngine when js-scriptengine.jar is included on the module path.The engine registers under several different names, including Graal.js, js, JavaScript, and javascript.Note that the Nashorn engine might be available under its names as well, if on the module path.To start GraalVM JavaScript from ScriptEngine, the following code can be used:new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName(&quot;Graal.js&quot;);To list all available engines:List&amp;lt;ScriptEngineFactory&amp;gt; engines = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineFactories();for (ScriptEngineFactory f : engines) {    System.out.println(f.getLanguageName() + &quot; &quot; + f.getEngineName() + &quot; &quot; + f.getNames());}Inspecting the Setup - Is the GraalVM Compiler Used as a JIT Compiler?The --engine.TraceCompilation flag enables a debug output whenever a JavaScript method is compiled by the GraalVM compiler.JavaScript source code with long-enough run time will trigger the compilation and print a log output:&amp;gt; function add(a,b) { return a+b; }; for (var i=0;i&amp;lt;1000*1000;i++) { add(i,i); }[truffle] opt done         add &amp;lt;opt&amp;gt; &amp;lt;split-c0875dd&amp;gt;                                   |ASTSize       7/    7 |Time    99(  90+9   )ms |DirectCallNodes I    0/D    0 |GraalNodes    22/   71 |CodeSize          274 |CodeAddress 0x7f76e4c1fe10 |Source    &amp;lt;shell&amp;gt;:1:1",

          "title": "Truffle Language Safepoint Tutorial",
          "content": "Truffle Language Safepoint TutorialAs of 21.1 Truffle has support for guest language safepoints.Truffle safepoints allow to interrupt the guest language execution to perform thread local actions submitted by a language or tool.A safepoint is a location during the guest language execution where the state is consistent and other operations can read its state.This replaces previous instrumentation or assumption-based approaches to safepoints, which required the code to be invalidated for a thread local action to be performed.The new implementation uses fast thread local checks and callee register saved stub calls to optimize for performance and keep the overhead minimal.This means that for every loop back-edge and method exit we perform an additional non-volatile read which can potentially lead to slight slow-downs.Use CasesCommon use-cases of Truffle language safepoints are:  Cancellation, requested exit or interruptions during guest language execution. The stack is unwound by submitting a thread local action.  Reading the current stack trace information for other threads than the currently executing thread.  Enumerating all object references active on the stack.  Running a guest signal handler or guest finalizer on a given thread.  Implement guest languages that expose a safepoint mechanism as part of their development toolkit.  Debuggers evaluating expressions in languages that do not support execution on multiple threads.Language SupportSafepoints are explicitly polled by invoking the TruffleSafepoint.poll(Node) method.A Truffle guest language implementation must ensure that a safepoint is polled repeatedly within a constant time interval.For example, a single arithmetic expression completes within a constant number of CPU cycles.However, a loop that summarizes values over an array uses a non-constant time dependent on the actual array size.This typically means that safepoints are best polled at the end of loops and at the end of function or method calls to cover recursion.In addition, any guest language code that blocks the execution, like guest language locks, need to use the  TruffleSafepoint.setBlocked(Interrupter) API to allow cooperative polling of safepoints while the thread is waiting.Please read more details on what steps language implementations need to take to support thread local actions in the javadoc.Thread Local ActionsLanguages and instruments can submit actions using their environment.Usage example:Env env; // language or instrument environmentenv.submitThreadLocal(null, new ThreadLocalAction(true /*side-effecting*/, true /*synchronous*/) {     @Override     protected void perform(Access access) {         assert access.getThread() == Thread.currentThread();     }});Read more in the javadoc.Current LimitationsThere is currently no way to run thread local actions while the thread is executing in boundary annotated methods unless the method cooperatively polls safepoints or uses the blocking API.Unfortunately it is not always possible to cooperatively poll safepoints, for example, if the code currently executes third party native code.A future improvement will allow to run code for other threads while they are blocked.This is one of the reasons why it is recommended to use ThreadLocalAction.Access.getThread() instead of directly using Thread.currentThread().When the native call returns it needs to wait for any thread local action that is currently executing for this thread.This will enable to collect guest language stack traces from other threads while they are blocked by uncooperative native code.Currently the action will be performed on the next safepoint location when the native code returns.Tooling for DebuggingThere are several debug options available:Excercise safepoints with SafepointALotSafepointALot is a tool to exercise every safepoint of an application and collect statistics.If enabled with the --engine.SafepointALot option it prints the statistics on the cpu time interval between safepoints at the end of an execution.For example, running:graalvm/bin/js --engine.SafepointALot js-benchmarks/harness.js -- octane-deltablue.jsPrints the following output to the log on context close:DeltaBlue: 540[engine] Safepoint Statistics  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Thread Name         Safepoints | Interval     Avg              Min              Max  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   main                  48384054 |            0.425 us           0.1 us       44281.1 us  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   All threads           48384054 |            0.425 us           0.1 us       42281.1 usIt is recommended for guest language implementations to try to stay below 1ms on average.Note that precise timing can depend on CPU and interruptions by the GC.Since GC times are included in the safepoint interval times, it is expected that the maximum is close to the maximum GC interruption time.Future versions of this tool will be able to exclude GC interruption times from this statistic.Trace thread local actionsThe option --engine.TraceThreadLocalActions allows to trace all thread local actions of any origin.Example output:[engine] [tl] submit                 0  thread[main]                action[SampleAction$8@5672f0d1]     all-threads[alive=4]        side-effecting     asynchronous[engine] [tl]   perform-start        0  thread[pool-1-thread-410]   action[SampleAction$8@5672f0d1][engine] [tl]   perform-start        0  thread[pool-1-thread-413]   action[SampleAction$8@5672f0d1][engine] [tl]   perform-start        0  thread[pool-1-thread-412]   action[SampleAction$8@5672f0d1][engine] [tl]   perform-done         0  thread[pool-1-thread-413]   action[SampleAction$8@5672f0d1][engine] [tl]   perform-done         0  thread[pool-1-thread-410]   action[SampleAction$8@5672f0d1][engine] [tl]   perform-start        0  thread[pool-1-thread-411]   action[SampleAction$8@5672f0d1][engine] [tl]   perform-done         0  thread[pool-1-thread-412]   action[SampleAction$8@5672f0d1][engine] [tl]   perform-done         0  thread[pool-1-thread-411]   action[SampleAction$8@5672f0d1][engine] [tl] done                   0  thread[pool-1-thread-411]   action[SampleAction$8@5672f0d1]Printing guest and host stack frames every time interval.The option --engine.TraceStackTraceInterval=1000 allows to set the time interval in milliseconds to repeatedly print the current stack trace.Note that the stack trace is printed on the next safepoint poll and therefore might not be accurate.graalvm/bin/js --engine.TraceStackTraceInterval=1000 js-benchmarks/harness.js -- octane-deltablue.jsPrints the following output:[engine] Stack Trace Thread main: org.graalvm.polyglot.PolyglotExceptionat &amp;lt;js&amp;gt;

          "title": "ScriptEngine Implementation",
          "content": "ScriptEngine ImplementationGraalVM provides a JSR-223 compliant javax.script.ScriptEngine implementation for running JavaScript.Note that this feature is provided for legacy reasons in order to allow easier migration for implementations currently based on a ScriptEngine.We strongly encourage users to use the org.graalvm.polyglot.Context interface in order to control many of the settings directly and benefit from finer-grained security settings in GraalVM.PrerequisiteNOTE: As of GraalVM for JDK 21, GraalVM no longer includes ScriptEngine by default.If you relied on that, you will have to migrate your setup to explicitly depend on the script engine module and add it to the module path.To get the js-scriptengine module, use a Maven dependency, like follows:&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.js&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;js-scriptengine&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;${graalvm.version}&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.js&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;js&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;${graalvm.version}&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;scope&amp;gt;runtime&amp;lt;/scope&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;If you are not using mvn, you will need to add the js-scriptengine.jar file to the module path manually, for example: --module-path=languages/js/graaljs-scriptengine.jar.In some case, you may also need to add --add-modules org.graalvm.js.scriptengine to the command line, to ensure that the ScriptEngine will be found.An explicit dependency on the org.graalvm.js.scriptengine module is only required if you want to use GraalJSScriptEngine directly (see below).Finally, it is also possible to use jlink to generate a custom Java runtime image that contains the JS ScriptEngine.An example pom.xml can be found in the GraalJS repository on GitHub.Recommendation: Use CompiledScript APITo avoid unnecessary re-compilation of JS sources, it is recommended to use CompiledScript.eval instead of ScriptEngine.eval. This prevents JIT-compiled code from being garbage-collected as long as the corresponding CompiledScript object is alive.Single-threaded example:ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager();ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName(&quot;js&quot;);CompiledScript script = ((Compilable) engine).compile(&quot;console.log(&#39;hello world&#39;);&quot;);script.eval();Multi-threaded example:ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager();ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName(&quot;js&quot;);CompiledScript script = ((Compilable) engine).compile(&quot;console.log(&#39;start&#39;);var start = Date.now(); while (Date.now()-start &amp;lt; 2000);console.log(&#39;end&#39;);&quot;);new Thread(new Runnable() {    @Override    public void run() {        try {            // Create ScriptEngine for this thread (with a shared polyglot Engine)            ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName(&quot;js&quot;);            script.eval(engine.getContext());        } catch (ScriptException scriptException) {            scriptException.printStackTrace();        }    }}).start();script.eval();Setting Options via BindingsThe  ScriptEngine interface does not provide a default way to set options.As a workaround, GraalJSScriptEngine supports setting some Context optionsthrough Bindings.These options are:  polyglot.js.allowHostAccess &amp;lt;boolean&amp;gt;  polyglot.js.allowNativeAccess &amp;lt;boolean&amp;gt;  polyglot.js.allowCreateThread &amp;lt;boolean&amp;gt;  polyglot.js.allowIO &amp;lt;boolean&amp;gt;  polyglot.js.allowHostClassLookup &amp;lt;boolean or Predicate&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;&amp;gt;  polyglot.js.allowHostClassLoading &amp;lt;boolean&amp;gt;  polyglot.js.allowAllAccess &amp;lt;boolean&amp;gt;  polyglot.js.nashorn-compat &amp;lt;boolean&amp;gt;  polyglot.js.ecmascript-version &amp;lt;String&amp;gt;These options control the sandboxing rules applied to evaluated JavaScript code and are set to false by default, unless the application was started in the Nashorn compatibility mode (--js.nashorn-compat=true).Note that using ScriptEngine implies allowing experimental options.This is an exhaustive list of allowed options to be passed via Bindings; in case you need to pass additional options to GraalVM JavaScript, you need to manually create a Context as shown below.To set an option via Bindings, use Bindings.put(&amp;lt;option name&amp;gt;, true) before the engine’s script context is initialized. Note thateven a call to Bindings#get(String) may lead to context initialization.The following code shows how to enable polyglot.js.allowHostAccess via Bindings:ScriptEngine engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName(&quot;JavaScript&quot;);Bindings bindings = engine.getBindings(ScriptContext.ENGINE_SCOPE);bindings.put(&quot;polyglot.js.allowHostAccess&quot;, true);bindings.put(&quot;polyglot.js.allowHostClassLookup&quot;, (Predicate&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;) s -&amp;gt; true);bindings.put(&quot;javaObj&quot;, new Object());engine.eval(&quot;(javaObj instanceof Java.type(&#39;java.lang.Object&#39;));&quot;); // it will not work without allowHostAccess and allowHostClassLookupThis example will not work if the user calls, e.g., engine.eval(&quot;var x = 1;&quot;), before calling bindings.put(&quot;polyglot.js.allowHostAccess&quot;, true);, sinceany call to eval forces context initialization.Setting Options via System PropertiesOptions to the JavaScript engine can be set via system properties before starting the JVM by prepending polyglot.:java -Dpolyglot.js.ecmascript-version=2022 MyApplicationOr, options to the JavaScript engine can be set programmatically from within Java before creating ScriptEngine. This, however, only works for the options passed to the JavaScript engine (like js.ecmascript), not for the six options mentioned above that can be set via the Bindings.Another caveat is that those system properties are shared by all concurrently executed ScriptEngines.Manually Creating Context for More FlexibilityContext options can also be passed to GraalJSScriptEngine directly, via an instance of Context.Builder:ScriptEngine engine = GraalJSScriptEngine.create(null,        Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;)        .allowHostAccess(HostAccess.ALL)        .allowHostClassLookup(s -&amp;gt; true)        .option(&quot;js.ecmascript-version&quot;, &quot;2022&quot;));engine.put(&quot;javaObj&quot;, new Object());engine.eval(&quot;(javaObj instanceof Java.type(&#39;java.lang.Object&#39;));&quot;);This allows setting all options available in GraalVM JavaScript.It does come at the cost of a hard dependency on GraalVM JavaScript, e.g., the GraalJSScriptEngine and Context classes.Supported File ExtensionsThe GraalVM JavaScript implementation of javax.script.ScriptEngine supports the js file extension for JavaScript source files, as well as the mjs extension for ES modules.",

          "content": "Specialization HistogramThis guide explains how to use the --engine.SpecializationStatistics option.The specialization histogram requires Truffle DSL nodes to be generated in a special way.So if you use the plain specialization histogram option it will just print the following:js --engine.SpecializationStatistics test.js[engine] Specialization histogram:No specialization statistics data was collected. Either no node with @Specialization annotations was executed or the interpreter was not compiled with -Atruffle.dsl.GenerateSpecializationStatistics=true e.g as parameter to the javac tool.Follow the advice of the error and recompile our interpreter.For mx users this is as simple as:mx build -c -A-Atruffle.dsl.GenerateSpecializationStatistics=trueAfter the rebuild, the specialization statistics are ready to be used.Make sure that your IDE does not recompile the sources automatically in the meantime.In this tutorial, a simple test.js script will be used:function test() {  var array = [42, &quot;&quot;, {}, []]  var globalVar = true;  for (element of array) {    globalVar = element;  }}test();Now the specialization statistics need to be enabled, in this example using the JavaScript launcher of GraalVM:js --experimental-options --engine.SpecializationStatistics test.jsAfter the script is executed a histogram for each class will be printed.The histograms will be ordered by the sum of executions of each node, whereas the most frequently used node class will be printed last.These are some of the histograms printed when executing test.js:(Note: The output is likely already outdated.) -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| Name                                                                         Instances          Executions     Executions per instance -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| JSWriteCurrentFrameSlotNodeGen                                               8 (17%)            18 (12%)        Min=         1 Avg=        2.25 Max=          5  MaxNode= test.js~5-7:76-128|   doBoolean &amp;lt;boolean&amp;gt;

Is there a specialization with a very common type combination that could benefit from further specialization?  Which specialization combination is common and could deserve its own specialization? This could indicate common polymorphism in the code that could be investigated.  What are common specializations, and does the order match the number of executions? Specializations that are most commonly used should be ordered first in the node class. This may lead to improvements in interpreter performance.  Are there unexpected specializations instantiated? If yes, investigate further using the printed source section.  Which specializations are instantiated often, and should therefore be optimized for memory footprint?  Were there nodes with the name Uncached in the profile? The use of uncached nodes should be rare. If they were used often, it can be worthwhile to dig deeper to see why.",

          "content": "Splitting AlgorithmThis guide gives an overview of the algorithm used in the implementation of Truffle call target splitting.The new implementation relies on the language implementations providing information on when a particular node turns polymorphic or increases its “degree” of polymorphism by, for example, adding an entry into an inline cache.This event is called a “polymorphic specialize”.This information is provided to the runtime by calling theNode.reportPolymorphicSpecialize method after the specialization is complete.This guide explains what happens after the call to reportPolymorphicSpecialize.You can find more information on how to correctly report polymorphic specializations in the Reporting Polymorphism guide.ApproachDetecting of suitable splitting candidates relies on the languages reporting polymorphic specializations.Once the specialization is reported, you can assume that the polymorphism is coming from somewhere in the caller chain of the call target hosting the newly polymorphic node, and that by splitting the right call target (or call targets) you can return this node to a monomorphic state.You then identify the call targets for which the splitting could result in monomorphization and mark them as “needs split”. During further execution, if the interpreter is about to execute a direct call to a call target that is marked as “needs split”, that call target will be split (provided there are no outstanding factors preventing it such as the root node not being allowed to be split,the AST being too big, etc.).This results in a new call target with a clean profile (i.e., all its nodes are returned to an uninitialized state) to bere-profiled specifically for this call site, since it is the only call site calling this new call target.Following recursive algorithm (expressed as pseudo code) is a simplified version of the approach used to decide which call targets need to be marked “needs split”.This algorithm is applied to every call target once one of its nodes reports a polymorphic specialization.The full implementation can be found in com.oracle.truffle.runtime.OptimizedCallTarget#maybeSetNeedsSplit.setNeedsSplit(callTarget)    if callTarget.needsSplit        return false    if sizeof(knownCallers(callTarget)) == 0        return false    if callCount(callTarget) == 1        return false    if sizeof(knownCallers(callTarget)) &amp;gt; 1        callTarget.needsSplit = true    else        callTarget.needsSplit = setNeedsSplit(caller(callTarget))    return callTarget.needsSplitAt the very beginning of the pseudo code you can have early termination conditions.If the call target is already marked as “needs split”, there is need to continue.Also, if the call targets has no known callers (e.g., it is the “main” of the execution) splitting is not applicable since splitting is inherently tied to duplicating ASTs for a particular call site.Finally, if this is happening during the first execution of call target, splitting is pointless since the polymorphic nature of the node is inevitable (i.e., not coming from the callers, but rather an integral property of that call target).In the second part of the pseudo code two cases are differentiated:1) The call target has multiple known callers - in this case you can assume that the polymorphism is coming from one of these multiple callers. Thus, you mark the call target as “needs split”.2) The call target has only one known caller - in this case you know that marking this call target as “needs split” cannot help remove the polymorphism. But, the polymorphism could be coming into this call target from its sole caller, which could have multiple callers and could be a candidate for splitting. Thus, you recursively apply the algorithm to the caller of our call target.Ignore for now the return value of our algorithm and its usage, and consider the following SimpleLanguage example to illustrate why this distinction between one and multiple callers is needed:function add(arg1, arg2) {    return arg1 + arg2;}function double(arg1) {    return add(arg1, arg1);}function callsDouble() {    double(1);    double(&quot;foo&quot;);}function main() {    i = 0;    while (i &amp;lt; 1000) {        callsDouble();    }}In this example, the node representing + in the add function will turn polymorphic once double is called with the string argument &quot;foo&quot; and this will be reported to the runtime and our algorithm will be applied to add.All of the early return checks will fail (add is not marked “needs split”, it has known callers and this is not its first execution).Observe that add has only one caller (double), so you apply the algorithm to double.Early returns all fail, and since double has multiple callers, you mark it as “needs split” and on later iterations calls to double are split resulting in the following code representation of the run time state:function add(arg1, arg2) {    return arg1 + arg2; // + is polymorphic}function double(arg1) {    return add(arg1, arg1);}function doubleSplit1(arg1) {    return add(arg1, arg1);}function doubleSplit2(arg1) {    return add(arg1, arg1);}function callsDouble() {    doubleSplit1(1);    doubleSplit2(&quot;foo&quot;);}function main() {    i = 0;    while (i &amp;lt; 1000) {        callsDouble();    }}As you can see, the source of the polymorphism was split, but that did not solve the issue, since both slits still call the same add function and the polymorphism remains.This is where the algorithms return value comes in to play.If the algorithm was successful in finding a target to mark than all the transitive callee’s of that target need to be marked “needs split” as well.With this final step in place, the final run time result of our splitting approach for the previous example can be represent as the following source code:function add(arg1, arg2) {    return arg1 + arg2; // + is polymorphic}function addSplit1(arg1, arg2) {    return arg1 + arg2;}function addSplit2(arg1, arg2) {    return arg1 + arg2;}function double(arg1) {    return add(arg1, arg1);}function doubleSplit1(arg1) {    return addSplit1(arg1, arg1);}function doubleSplit2(arg1) {    return addSplit2(arg1, arg1);}function callsDouble() {    doubleSplit1(1);    doubleSplit2(&quot;foo&quot;);}function main() {    i = 0;    while (i &amp;lt; 1000) {        callsDouble();    }}Final note to observe at this point is that the splitting does not remove the original call targets, and that they still have polymorphism in their profiles.Thus, even if new calls to these call targets are created, they will also be split.Consider if the main of the previous example looked as follows.function main() {    i = 0;    while (i &amp;lt; 1000) {        callsDouble();    }    add(1,2); // this line was added}Once the execution reaches the newly added line you do not want it to call the add function with the polymorphic + since the arguments here do not merit the polymorphism.Luckily, since add was already marked as “needs split”, it will remain so during the entire execution, and this final call to add with cause another split of the add functions.",

          "content": "Points-to Analysis ReportsThe points-to analysis produces two kinds of reports: an analysis call tree and an object tree. This information is produced by an intermediate step in the building process and represents the static analysis view of the call graph and heap object graph. These graphs are further transformed in the building process before they are compiled ahead-of-time into the binary and written into the binary heap, respectively.In addition to the comprehensive report of the whole analysis universe, the points-to analysis can also produce reachability reports on why certain type/method/field is reachable.Call treeThe call tree is a a breadth-first tree reduction of the call graph as seen by the points-to analysis.The points-to analysis eliminates calls to methods that it determines cannot be reachable at runtime, based on the analyzed receiver types.It also completely eliminates invocations in unreachable code blocks, such as blocks guarded by a type check that always fails.The call tree report is enabled using the -H:+PrintAnalysisCallTree command-line option and can be formatted either as a TXT file (default) or as a set of CSV files using the -H:PrintAnalysisCallTreeType=CSV option.TXT FormatWhen using the TXT format a file with the following structure is generated:VM Entry Points├── entry &amp;lt;entry-method&amp;gt; id=&amp;lt;entry-method-id&amp;gt;│   ├── directly calls &amp;lt;callee&amp;gt; id=&amp;lt;callee-id&amp;gt; @bci=&amp;lt;invoke-bci&amp;gt;│   │   └── &amp;lt;callee-sub-tree&amp;gt;│   ├── virtually calls &amp;lt;callee&amp;gt; @bci=&amp;lt;invoke-bci&amp;gt;│   │   ├── is overridden by &amp;lt;override-method-i&amp;gt; id=&amp;lt;override-method-i-id&amp;gt;│   │   │   └── &amp;lt;callee-sub-tree&amp;gt;│   │   └── is overridden by &amp;lt;override-method-j&amp;gt; id-ref=&amp;lt;override-method-j-id&amp;gt;│   └── interfacially calls &amp;lt;callee&amp;gt; @bci=&amp;lt;invoke-bci&amp;gt;│       ├── is implemented by &amp;lt;implementation-method-x&amp;gt; id=&amp;lt;implementation-method-x-id&amp;gt;│       │   └── &amp;lt;callee-sub-tree&amp;gt;│       └── is implemented by &amp;lt;implementation-method-y&amp;gt; id-ref=&amp;lt;implementation-method-y-id&amp;gt;├── entry &amp;lt;entry-method&amp;gt; id=&amp;lt;entry-method-id&amp;gt;│   └── &amp;lt;callee-sub-tree&amp;gt;└── ...The tags between &amp;lt;and &amp;gt; are expanded with concrete values, the remainder is printed as illustrated.The methods are formatted using &amp;lt;qualified-holder&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;method-name&amp;gt;(&amp;lt;qualified-parameters&amp;gt;):&amp;lt;qualified-return-type&amp;gt; and are expanded until no more callees can be reached.Since this is a tree reduction of the call graph each concrete method is expanded exactly once.The tree representation inherently omits calls to methods that have already been explored in a different branch or previously on the same branch.This restriction implicitly fixes the recursion problem.To convey the information that is lost through tree reduction each concrete method is given a unique id.Thus when a method is reached for the first time it declares an identifier as id=&amp;lt;method-id&amp;gt;.Subsequent discoveries of the same method use an identifier reference to point to the previously expansion location: id-ref=&amp;lt;method-id&amp;gt;.Each id=&amp;lt;method-id&amp;gt; and id-ref=&amp;lt;method-id&amp;gt; are followed by a blank space to make it easy to search.Each invoke is tagged with the invocation bci: @bci=&amp;lt;invoke-bci&amp;gt;.For invokes of inline methods the &amp;lt;invoke-bci&amp;gt; is a list of bci values, separated with -&amp;gt;, enumerating the inline locations, backwards to the original invocation location.CSV FormatWhen using the CSV format a set of files containing raw data for methods and their relationships is generated.The aim of these files is to enable this raw data to be easily imported into a graph database.A graph database can provide the following functionality:  Sophisticated graphical visualization of the call tree graph that provides a different perspective compared to text-based formats.  Ability to execute complex queries that can (for example) show a subset of the tree that causes certain code path to be included in the call tree analysis.This querying functionality is crucial in making big analysis call trees manageable.The process to import the files into a graph database is specific to each database.Please follow the instructions provided by the graph database provider.Object treeThe object tree is an exhaustive expansion of the objects included in the native binary heap.The tree is obtained by a depth first walk of the native binary heap object graph.It is enabled using the -H:+PrintImageObjectTree option.The roots are either static fields or method graphs that contain embedded constants.The printed values are concrete constant objects added to the native binary heap.Produces a file with the structure:Heap roots├── root &amp;lt;root-field&amp;gt;

it will match all the arrays of that type, of all dimensions.)For roots the pattern is based on the string format of the root as described above.The pattern accepts the * modifier:  ends-with: *&amp;lt;str&amp;gt; - the pattern exactly matches all entries that end with &amp;lt;str&amp;gt;  starts-with: &amp;lt;str&amp;gt;* - the pattern exactly matches all entries that start with &amp;lt;str&amp;gt;  contains: *&amp;lt;str&amp;gt;* - the pattern exactly matches all entries that contain &amp;lt;str&amp;gt;

 -H:AbortOnMethodReachable=&amp;lt;pattern&amp;gt;  -H:AbortOnFieldReachable=&amp;lt;pattern&amp;gt;For each option, the right-hand side specifies the pattern of the code element to be diagnosed.  The syntax for specifying types and fields is the same as that of suppression/expansion (See documentation for -H:ImageObjectTreeSuppressTypes above).  The syntax for specifying methods is the same as that of method filters (See documentation for -Djdk.graal.MethodFilter).When one of the option is enabled and the corresponding code element is reachable, a reachability trace will be dumped to a TXT file and Native Image will abort.Here is an example of the reachability report for -H:AbortOnTypeReachable=java.io.File:Type java.io.File is marked as allocatedat virtual method com.oracle.svm.core.jdk.NativeLibrarySupport.loadLibraryRelative(NativeLibrarySupport.java:105), implementation invoked├── at virtual method com.oracle.svm.core.jdk.JNIPlatformNativeLibrarySupport.loadJavaLibrary(JNIPlatformNativeLibrarySupport.java:44), implementation invoked│       ├── at virtual method com.oracle.svm.core.posix.PosixNativeLibrarySupport.loadJavaLibrary(PosixNativeLibraryFeature.java:117), implementation invoked│       │       ├── at virtual method com.oracle.svm.core.posix.PosixNativeLibrarySupport.initializeBuiltinLibraries(PosixNativeLibraryFeature.java:98), implementation invoked│       │       │       ├── at static method com.oracle.svm.core.graal.snippets.CEntryPointSnippets.initializeIsolate(CEntryPointSnippets.java:346), implementation invoked│       │       │       │       str: static root method│       │       │       └── type com.oracle.svm.core.posix.PosixNativeLibrarySupport is marked as in-heap│       │       │               scanning root com.oracle.svm.core.posix.PosixNativeLibrarySupport@4839bf0d: com.oracle.svm.core.posix.PosixNativeLibrarySupport@4839bf0d embedded in│       │       │                   org.graalvm.nativeimage.ImageSingletons.lookup(ImageSingletons.java)│       │       │                   at static method org.graalvm.nativeimage.ImageSingletons.lookup(Class), intrinsified│       │       │                       at static method com.oracle.svm.core.graal.snippets.CEntryPointSnippets.createIsolate(CEntryPointSnippets.java:209), implementation invoked│       │       └── type com.oracle.svm.core.posix.PosixNativeLibrarySupport is marked as in-heap│       └── type com.oracle.svm.core.jdk.JNIPlatformNativeLibrarySupport is reachable└── type com.oracle.svm.core.jdk.NativeLibrarySupport is marked as in-heap        scanning root com.oracle.svm.core.jdk.NativeLibrarySupport@6e06bbea: com.oracle.svm.core.jdk.NativeLibrarySupport@6e06bbea embedded in            org.graalvm.nativeimage.ImageSingletons.lookup(ImageSingletons.java)            at static method org.graalvm.nativeimage.ImageSingletons.lookup(Class), intrinsifiedReport FilesThe reports are generated in the reports subdirectory, relative to the build directory.When executing the native-image executable the build directory defaults to the working directory and can be modified using the -H:Path=&amp;lt;dir&amp;gt; option.The call tree report name has the structure call_tree_&amp;lt;binary_name&amp;gt;_&amp;lt;date_time&amp;gt;.txt when using the TXT format or, when using the CSV format, the call tree reports’ names have the structure call_tree_*_&amp;lt;binary_name&amp;gt;_&amp;lt;date_time&amp;gt;.csv.When producing CSV formatted call tree reports, symbolic links following the structure call_tree_*.csv pointing to the latest call tree CSV reports are also generated.The object tree report name has the structure: object_tree_&amp;lt;binary_name&amp;gt;_&amp;lt;date_time&amp;gt;.txt.The binary name is the name of the generated binary, which can be set with the -H:Name=&amp;lt;name&amp;gt; option.The &amp;lt;date_time&amp;gt; is in the yyyyMMdd_HHmmss format.The reachability reports are also located in the reports directory.They follow the same naming convention:  Type reachability report: trace_types_&amp;lt;binary_name&amp;gt;_&amp;lt;date_time&amp;gt;.txt  Method reachability report: trace_methods_&amp;lt;binary_name&amp;gt;_&amp;lt;date_time&amp;gt;.txt  Field reachability report: trace_fields_&amp;lt;binary_name&amp;gt;_&amp;lt;date_time&amp;gt;.txtFurther Reading  Command-line Options",

          "title": "Static Object Model",
          "content": "Static Object ModelThis guide demonstrates how to get started with using the StaticShape and StaticProperty APIs introduced with GraalVM 21.3.0.The full documentation can be found in the Javadoc.MotivationThe Static Object Model provides abstractions to represent the layout of objects that, once defined, do not change the number and the type of their properties.It is particularly well suited for, but not limited to, the implementation of the object model of static programming languages.Its APIs define the object layout (StaticShape), execute property accesses (StaticProperty), and allocate static objects (DefaultStaticObjectFactory).The implementation is efficient and executes safety checks on property accesses that can be disabled if they are already executed by the language implementation, for example by a verifier.The Static Object Model does not provide constructs to model the visibility of properties and does not distinguish between static and instance properties.Its APIs are not compatible with those of the Dynamic Object Model, which is more suited for dynamic languages.Getting StartedIn this first example, let’s assume that:  language is an instance of the TruffleLanguage that we are implementing.  We want to represent an object with the following static layout:          An int property named property1.      An Object property named property2 which can be stored as a final field. Later we will see in detail what this implies.      Here is how to use the Static Object Model to represent this layout:public class GettingStarted {    public void simpleShape(TruffleLanguage&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; language) {        StaticShape.Builder builder = StaticShape.newBuilder(language);        StaticProperty p1 = new DefaultStaticProperty(&quot;property1&quot;);        StaticProperty p2 = new DefaultStaticProperty(&quot;property2&quot;);        builder.property(p1, int.class, false);        builder.property(p2, Object.class, true);        StaticShape&amp;lt;DefaultStaticObjectFactory&amp;gt; shape = builder.build();        Object staticObject = shape.getFactory().create();        ...    }}We start by creating a StaticShape.Builder instance, passing a reference to the language that we are implementing.Then, we create DefaultStaticProperty instances that represent the properties that we want to add to the static object layout.The String id passed as argument must be unique within a builder.After creating the properties we register them to the builder instance:  The first argument is the StaticProperty that we register.  The second argument is the type of the property. It can be a primitive class or Object.class.  The third argument is a boolean value that defines if the property can be stored as a final field.This gives the compiler the opportunity to perform additional optimizations.For example, reads to this property might be constant-folded.It’s important to note that the Static Object Model does not check if a property stored as final is not assigned more than once and that it is assigned before it is read.Doing so might lead to wrong behavior of the program, and it is up to the user to enforce that this cannot happen.We then create a new static shape calling builder.build().To allocate the static object, we retrieve the DefaultStaticObjectFactory from the shape, and we invoke its create() method.Now that we have our static object instance, let’s see how to use the static properties to perform property accesses.Expanding the example above:public class GettingStarted {    public void simpleShape(TruffleLanguage&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; language) {        ...        p1.setInt(staticObject, 42);        p2.setObject(staticObject, &quot;42&quot;);        assert p1.getInt(staticObject) == 42;        assert p2.getObject(staticObject).equals(&quot;42&quot;);    }}Shape HierarchiesIt is possible to create a shape hierarchy by declaring that a new shape should extend an existing one.This is done by passing the parent shape as argument to StaticShape.Builder.build(StaticShape) when creating the child shape.Properties of the parent shape can then be used to access values stored in static objects of the child shape.In the following example we create a parent shape identical to the one discussed in the previous section, then we extend it with a child shape that hides one of the properties of the parent shape.Finally, we demonstrate how the various properties can be accessed.public class Subshapes {    public void simpleSubShape(TruffleLanguage&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; language) {        // Create a shape        StaticShape.Builder b1 = StaticShape.newBuilder(language);        StaticProperty s1p1 = new DefaultStaticProperty(&quot;property1&quot;);        StaticProperty s1p2 = new DefaultStaticProperty(&quot;property2&quot;);        b1.property(s1p1, int.class, false).property(s1p2, Object.class, true);        StaticShape&amp;lt;DefaultStaticObjectFactory&amp;gt; s1 = b1.build();        // Create a sub-shape        StaticShape.Builder b2 = StaticShape.newBuilder(language);        StaticProperty s2p1 = new DefaultStaticProperty(&quot;property1&quot;);        b2.property(s2p1, int.class, false);        StaticShape&amp;lt;DefaultStaticObjectFactory&amp;gt; s2 = b2.build(s1); // passing a shape as argument builds a sub-shape        // Create a static object for the sub-shape        Object o2 = s2.getFactory().create();        // Perform property accesses        s1p1.setInt(o2, 42);        s1p2.setObject(o2, &quot;42&quot;);        s2p1.setInt(o2, 24);        assert s1p1.getInt(o2) == 42;        assert s1p2.getObject(o2).equals(&quot;42&quot;);        assert s2p1.getInt(o2) == 24;    }}Extending custom base classesTo reduce memory footprint, the language implementor might want static objects to extend the class that represents guest-level objects.This is complicated by the fact that StaticShape.getFactory() must return an instance of the factory class that allocates static objects.To achieve this, we first need to declare an interface that:  Defines a method for each visible constructor of the static object super class that we want to invoke.  The arguments of each method must match those of the corresponding constructor.  The return type of each method must be assignable from the static object super class.For example, if the static objects should extend this class:public abstract class MyStaticObject {    final String arg1;    final Object arg2;    public MyStaticObject(String arg1) {        this(arg1, null);    }    public MyStaticObject(String arg1, Object arg2) {        this.arg1 = arg1;        this.arg2 = arg2;    }}We need to declare the following factory interface:public interface MyStaticObjectFactory {    MyStaticObject create(String arg1);    MyStaticObject create(String arg1, Object arg2);}Finally, this is how to allocate the custom static objects:public void customStaticObject(TruffleLanguage&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; language) {    StaticProperty property = new DefaultStaticProperty(&quot;arg1&quot;);    StaticShape&amp;lt;MyStaticObjectFactory&amp;gt; shape = StaticShape.newBuilder(language).property(property, Object.class, false).build(MyStaticObject.class, MyStaticObjectFactory.class);    MyStaticObject staticObject = shape.getFactory().create(&quot;arg1&quot;);    property.setObject(staticObject, &quot;42&quot;);    assert staticObject.arg1.equals(&quot;arg1&quot;); // fields of the custom super class are directly accessible    assert property.getObject(staticObject).equals(&quot;42&quot;); // static properties are accessible as usual}As you can see from the example above, fields and methods of the custom parent class are directly accessible and are not hidden by the static properties of the static object.Reducing memory footprintReading the Javadoc, you might have noticed that StaticShape does not provide an API to access the associated static properties.This reduces memory footprint in case the language implementation already has a way to store this information.For example, an implementation of the Java language might want to store the static shape in the class that represents a Java class, and a static property in the class that represents a Java field.In this case, the class representing a Java class should already have a way to retrieve the Java fields associated to it, hence the static properties associated to the shape.To further reduce memory footprint, the language implementor might want the class representing a Java field to extend StaticProperty.Instead of storing the static property in the class that represents fields:class MyField {    final StaticProperty p;    MyField(StaticProperty p) {        this.p = p;    }}new MyField(new DefaultStaticProperty(&quot;property1&quot;));The class that represents fields can extend StaticProperty:class MyField extends StaticProperty {    final Object name;    MyField(Object name) {        this.name = name;    }    @Override    public String getId() {        return name.toString(); // this string must be a unique identifier within a Builder    }}new MyField(&quot;property1&quot;);Safety ChecksOn property access, the Static Object Model performs two types of safety checks:  That the StaticProperty method matches the type of the static property.Example of wrong access:public void wrongMethod(TruffleLanguage&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; language) {    StaticShape.Builder builder = StaticShape.newBuilder(language);    StaticProperty property = new DefaultStaticProperty(&quot;property&quot;);    Object staticObject = builder.property(property, int.class, false).build().getFactory().create();    property.setObject(staticObject, &quot;wrong access type&quot;); // throws IllegalArgumentException  That the object passed to the accessor method matches the shape generated by the builder to which the property is associated, or one of its child shapes.Example of wrong access:public void wrongShape(TruffleLanguage&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; language) {    StaticShape.Builder builder = StaticShape.newBuilder(language);    StaticProperty property = new DefaultStaticProperty(&quot;property&quot;);;    Object staticObject1 = builder.property(property, Object.class, false).build().getFactory().create();    Object staticObject2 = StaticShape.newBuilder(language).build().getFactory().create();    property.setObject(staticObject2, &quot;wrong shape&quot;); // throws IllegalArgumentException}While these checks are often useful, they might be redundant if the language implementation already performs them, for example using a verifier.While the first type of checks (on property type) is very efficient and cannot be disabled, the second type of checks (on the shape) is computationally expensive and can be disabled via a command line argument:--experimental-options --engine.RelaxStaticObjectSafetyChecks=trueor when creating the Context:Context context = Context.newBuilder() //                         .allowExperimentalOptions(true) //                         .option(&quot;engine.RelaxStaticObjectSafetyChecks&quot;, &quot;true&quot;) //                         .build();It is highly discouraged to relax safety checks in absence of other equivalent checks.If the assumption on the correctness of the shape of the static objects is wrong, the VM is likely to crash.",

          "content": "Polyglot API-based Test Compatibility KitThe Test Compatibility Kit (TCK) is a collection of tests verifying the TruffleLanguage inter-operability and instrumentation.The TCK is based on the org.graalvm.polyglot API.Adding a LanguageTo test your language, implement the LanguageProvider.The LanguageProviders are loaded using the java.util.ServiceLoader, so you need to register your implementation in the META-INF/services/org.graalvm.polyglot.tck.LanguageProvider file.The LanguageProvider should provide the language data types, language expressions (operators), and language control flow statements represented as functions returning the data type or executing the operator (statement).To allow composition of the returned functions, the parameter and return types have to be assigned to them usingthe Snippet.Builder.The LanguageProvider should also provide simple but representative scripts which the TCK can use to test instrumentation.Running TCK Tests with mxThe tests are executed using mx unitest. When running the tests, all LanguageProviders in the primary suite and dependent suites are used. The truffle suite provides the java-host LanguageProvider, creating Java data types and Proxies to test Java inter-operability.To run just the TCK tests use:mx unittest com.oracle.truffle.tck.testsOr, simply use:mx tckTo restrict the TCK tests to test a certain language, use the tck.language property.The following example tests JavaScript with data types from all available languages:mx tck -Dtck.language=jsTo restrict the data types to a certain language, use the tck.values property.The following example tests JavaScript with Java types:mx tck -Dtck.values=java-host -Dtck.language=jsTo run a single test, specify the full test name.For example, to run a test for SimpleLanguage + operator with SimpleLanguage number and big number use:mx tck &#39;ExpressionTest#testExpression[sl::+(sl::number, sl::number)]&#39;To run the TCK tests on GraalVM it is enough to set the mx --java-home to point to GraalVM:mx --java-home=&amp;lt;path_to_graalvm&amp;gt; tckTo disable output and error output use the tck.verbose property:mx tck -Dtck.verbose=falseTo disable output and error output only for a certain test, use the tck.{TestSimpleName}.verbose property:mx tck -Dtck.ErrorTypeTest.verbose=falseYou can also disable output and error output for all tests but one:mx tck -Dtck.verbose=false -Dtck.ErrorTypeTest.verbose=trueRunning TCK Tests without mxThe Python TCK runner can be used to execute the Truffle TCK on top of GraalVM. The script requires Maven for downloading the TCK artifacts.To execute TCK tests on GraalVM use:python tck.py -g &amp;lt;path_to_graalvm&amp;gt;To include your own language and TCK provider use:python tck.py -g &amp;lt;path_to_graalvm&amp;gt; -cp &amp;lt;path_to_tck_provider_jars&amp;gt; -lp &amp;lt;path_to_language_jars&amp;gt;To restrict tests to a certain language, use the language ID as a first unnamed option.The following example executes tests only for the JavaScript language:python tck.py -g &amp;lt;path_to_graalvm&amp;gt; jsTo execute the tests under debugger use the -d or --dbg &amp;lt;port&amp;gt; option:python tck.py -d -g &amp;lt;path_to_graalvm&amp;gt;The TCK tests can be filtered by test names. To execute just the ScriptTest for the JavaScript TCK provider use:python tck.py -g &amp;lt;path_to_graalvm&amp;gt; js default ScriptTestThe TCK tests can be executed in compile mode in which all calltargets are compiled before they are executed.To execute JavaScript tests in compile mode use:python tck.py -g &amp;lt;path_to_graalvm&amp;gt; js compile",

          "content": "Truffle Approach to the Compilation QueueAs of version 21.2.0 Truffle has a new approach to compilation queueing.This document gives motivation and an overview of this approach.What is a Compilation queue?During execution of guest code each Truffle call target counts how many times it was executed as well as how many loop iterations happened during those executions (i.e. the target’s “call and loop count”).Once this counter reaches a certain threshold the call target is deemed “hot” and scheduled for compilation.In order to minimize the impact this has on the execution of the guest code the notion that the target should be compiled is made concrete as a compilation task and placed into a compilation queue to await compilation.The Truffle runtime spawns several compiler threads (--engine.CompilerThreads) that take tasks from the queue and compile the specified call targets.The initial implementation of the compilation queue in Truffle was a straightforward FIFO queue.This approach has important limitations with respect to warmup characteristics of the guest code execution.Namely, not all call targets are equally important to compile.The aim is to identify targets which account for more execution time and compile them first, thus reaching better performance sooner.Since call targets are queued for compilation when a counter reaches a certain threshold a FIFO queue would compile targets in order of reaching that threshold, which in practise does not correlate to actual execution time.Consider the following toy JavaScript example:function lowUsage() {    for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; COMPILATION_THRESHOLD; i++) {        // Do something    }}function highUsage() {    for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; 100 * COMPILATION_THRESHOLD; i++) {        // Do something    }}while(true) {    lowUsage();    highUsage();}Both the lowUsage and the highUsage function will reach a high enough call and loop count threshold even on the first execution, but the lowUsage function will reach it first.Using a FIFO queue, we would compile the lowUsage function first, even though this example illustrates that the highUsage function should be compiled first in order to reach better performance sooner.Traversing Compilation QueueThe new compilation queue in Truffle, colloquially called “Traversing Compilation Queue”, takes a more dynamic approach to selecting the order in which targets are compiled.Every time a compiler thread requests the next compilation task the queue will traverse all the entries in the queue and pick the one with the highest priority.A task’s priority is determined based on several factors.For starters, targets scheduled for first-tier compilation (i.e. first-tier tasks) always have higher priority than second-tier tasks.The rational behind this is that performance difference between executing code in the interpreter and executing it in first-tier compiled code is much greater then the difference between tier-one and tier-two compiled code, meaning that we get more benefit from compiling these targets sooner.Also, first-tier compilations are usually take less time, thus one compiler thread can finish multiple first-tier compilations in the same time it takes to complete one second-tier compilation.This approach has been shown to underperform in certain scenarios and might be improved upon in the coming versions.When comparing two tasks of the same tier, we first consider their compilation history and give priority to tasks which were previously compiled with a higher compiler tier.For example, if a call target get first-tier compiled, then gets invalidated for some reason and then gets queued for a first-tier compilation again, it takes priority over all other first tier targets that have never before been compiled.The reasoning is that if it was previously compiled, it is obviously important and should not be penalized more than necessary by its invalidation.Finally, if the two previous conditions can’t differentiate the priority between two tasks we give priority to the task with the higher “weight”.The weight is a function of the target’s call and loop count and time.It is defined as a product of the target’s call and loop count with the rate at which that call and loop count has grown in the past 1ms.Using the target’s call and loop count as a proxy for amount of time spent executing that call target, this metric aims to balance total time spent executing that call target with the recent growth of that time.This gives a priority boost to targets that are currently “very hot” when comparing to targets that were “hot” but are not being executed a lot currently.For performance reasons the weight for tasks is cached and reused for a period of 1ms. If the cached value is older than 1ms, it is recalculated.The traversing compilation queue is on by default as of version 21.2.0 and can be disabled using --engine.TraversingCompilationQueue=false.Dynamic Compilation ThresholdsOne problem of the traversing compilation queue is that it needs to traverse all the entries in the queue to get up-to-date weights and choose the highest priority task.This does not have a significant performance impact as long as the size of the queue remains reasonable.This means that in order to always choose the highest priority task in a reasonable about of time we need to ensure that the queue does not grow indefinitely.This is achieved by an approach we call “dynamic compilation thresholds”.Simply put, dynamic compilation thresholds means that the compilation threshold (the one each call target’s call and loop count is compared against when determining whether to compile it) may change over time depending on the state of the queue.If the queue is overloaded we aim to increase the compilation thresholds to reduce the number of incoming compilation tasks, i.e. targets need to be “more hot” to get scheduled for compilation.On the other hand, if the queue is close to empty, we can reduce the compilation thresholds to allow more targets to get scheduled for compilation, i.e. the compilation threads are in danger of idling so let’s give them even “less hot” targets to compile.We call this changing of the thresholds “scaling” as the thresholds are in practice just multiple by a “scale factor” determined by a scale function.The scale function takes as input the “load” of the queue, which is the number of tasks in the queue divided by the number of compiler threads.We intentionally control for the number of compiler threads since the raw number of tasks in the queue is not a good proxy of how much compilation pressure there is.For example, let’s assume that an average compilation takes 100ms and that there are 160 tasks in the queue.A runtime with 16 threads will finish all the tasks in approximately 10 * 100ms i.e. 1 second.On the other hand, a runtime with 2 compiler thread will take approximately 80 * 100ms, i.e. 8 seconds.The scale function is defined by 3 parameters: --engine.DynamicCompilationThresholdsMinScale, --engine.DynamicCompilationThresholdsMinNormalLoad and DynamicCompilationThresholdsMaxNormalLoad.The --engine.DynamicCompilationThresholdsMinScale option defines how low we are willing to scale the thresholds.It has a default value of 0.1, meaning that the compilation thresholds will never be scaled below 10% of their default value.This in practice means that, by definition, scale(0) = DynamicCompilationThresholdsMinScale or for default values scale(0) = 0.1The --engine.DynamicCompilationThresholdsMinNormalLoad option defines the minimal load at which compilation thresholds will not be scaled.This means that as long as the load of the queue is above this value the runtime will not scale down the compilation thresholds.This in practice means that, by definition, scale(DynamicCompilationThresholdsMinScale) = 1 or for default values scale(10) = 1The --engine.DynamicCompilationThresholdsMaxNormalLoad option defines the maximal load at which compilation thresholds will not be scaled.This means that as long as the load of the queue is below this value the runtime will not scale up the compilation thresholds.This in practice means that, by definition, scale(DynamicCompilationThresholdsMaxScale) = 1 or for default values scale(90) = 1So far we’ve defined the scale function at 3 points.For all values between those points the scale function is a straight line connecting those two points.This means that for all values between the minimal and maximal normal load the scale function is 1 by definition.For values between 0 and the minimal normal load the scale function grows linearly between the minimal scale and 1.Let’s define the slope of this function as s.Now, for the remainder of the functions domain, i.e. the values greater than the maximum normal load, we define scale to be a linear function with slope s passing through the point (DynamicCompilationThresholdsMaxNormalLoad, 1).The following is an ASCII art plot of the scale function which should illustrate how it’s defined.          ^ scale          |          |                                            /          |                                           /          |

          "content": "Truffle Library GuideTruffle Libraries allow language implementations to use polymorphic dispatch for receiver types with support for implementation-specific caching/profiling and automatic support for uncached dispatch.Truffle Libraries enable modularity and encapsulation for representation types language implementations on top of Truffle.Read this guide first before using them.Getting StartedThis tutorial provides a trace through a use-case on how to use Truffle Libraries.The full API documentation can be found in the Javadoc.This document assumes prior knowledge of Truffle APIs and the use of @Specialization with the @Cached annotation.Motivating ExampleWhen implementing arrays in Truffle Languages it is often necessary to use multiple representations for efficiency.For example, if the array is constructed from an arithmetic sequence of integers (e.g., range(from: 1, step: 2, length: 3)), then it is best represented using the start, stride, and length instead of materializing the full array.Of course, when an array element is written, then the array needs to be materialized.In this example we are going to implement an array implementation with two representations:  Buffer: represents a materialized array representation backed by a Java array.  Sequence: represents an arithmetic sequence of numbers represented by start, stride and length: [start, start + 1 * stride, ..., start + (length - 1) * stride].To keep the example simple we will only support int values and we will ignore index bounds error handling.We will also just implement the read operation and not the typically more complicated write operation.To make the example more interesting, we will implement an optimization that will let the compiler allow constant fold sequenced array accesses even if the array receiver value is not constant.Assume we have the following code snippet range(start, stride, length)[2].In this snippet, the variables start and stride are not known to be constant values, therefore, equivalent code to start + stride * 2 gets compiled.However, if the start and stride values are known to always be the same then the compiler could constant-fold the entire operation.This optimization requires the use of caching.We will later show how this works.In the dynamic array implementation of GraalVM’s JavaScript runtime, we use 20 different representations.There are representations for constant, zero-based, contiguous, holes, and sparse arrays.Some representations are further specialized for the types byte, int, double, JSObject, and Object.The source code can be found here. Note: Currently, JavaScript arrays do not use Truffle Libraries yet.In the following sections, we discuss multiple implementation strategies for the array representations, ultimately describing how Truffle Libraries can be used to achieve this.Strategy 1: Specialization per RepresentationFor this strategy, we will start by declaring classes for the two representations BufferArray and SequenceArray.final class BufferArray {    int length;    int[] buffer;    /*...*/}final class SequenceArray {    final int start;    final int stride;    final int length;    /*...*/}The BufferArray implementation has a mutable buffer and length and is used as the materialized array representation.The sequence array is represented by the final fields start, stride, and length.Now, we specify the basic read operations like this:abstract class ExpressionNode extends Node {    abstract Object execute(VirtualFrame frame);}@NodeChild @NodeChildabstract class ArrayReadNode extends ExpressionNode {    @Specialization    int doBuffer(BufferArray array, int index) {        return array.buffer[index];    }    @Specialization    int doSequence(SequenceArray seq, int index) {        return seq.start + seq.stride * index;    }}The array read node specifies two specializations for the buffer version and the sequence.As mentioned before we are going to ignore error bounds checks for simplicity.Now we try to make the array read specialize on the constant-ness of values of the sequence in order to allow the range(start, stride, length)[2] example to fold if start and stride are constant.To find out whether start and stride are constants we need to profile their value.To profile these values we need to add another specialization to the array read operation like this:@NodeChild @NodeChildclass ArrayReadNode extends ExpressionNode {    /* doBuffer() */    @Specialization(guards = {&quot;seq.stride == cachedStride&quot;,                              &quot;seq.start  == cachedStart&quot;}, limit = &quot;1&quot;)    int doSequenceCached(SequenceArray seq, int index,             @Cached(&quot;seq.start&quot;)  int cachedStart,             @Cached(&quot;seq.stride&quot;) int cachedStride) {        return cachedStart + cachedStride * index;    }    /* doSequence() */}If the speculation guards of this specialization succeed then the start and stride are effectively constant.For example, with the values 3 and 2, the compiler would see 3 + 2 * 2 which is 7.The limit is set to 1 to only try this speculation once.It would likely be inefficient to increase the limit as this would introduce additional control flow to the compiled code.If the speculation does not succeed, i.e., if the operation observes multiple start and stride values, we want to fall back to the normal sequence specialization.To achieve this we change the doSequence specialization by adding replaces = &quot;doSequenceCached&quot; like this:@NodeChild @NodeChildclass ArrayReadNode extends ExpressionNode {    /* doSequenceCached() */    @Specialization(replaces = &quot;doSequenceCached&quot;)    int doSequence(SequenceArray seq, int index) {        return seq.start + seq.stride * index;    }}Now we have achieved the goal of implementing our array representations including additional profiling.The runnable source code for Strategy 1 can be found here.This strategy has some nice properties:  The operation is easy to read and all cases are fully enumerated.  The generated code of the read node only requires a single bit per specialization to remember which representation type was observed at runtime.We would already be done with this tutorial if there would not be some problems with this:  New representations cannot be loaded dynamically; they need to be statically known, making the separation of representation types from operations impossible.  Changing or adding representation types often requires the modification of many operations.  Representation classes need to expose most implementation details to operations (no encapsulation).These problems are the primary motivations for Truffle Libraries.Strategy 2: Java InterfacesNow we will try to address these problems by using Java interfaces.We start by defining an array interface:interface Array {    int read(int index);}The implementations can now implement the Array interface and implement the read method in the representation class.final class BufferArray implements Array {    private int length;    private int[] buffer;    /*...*/    @Override public int read(int index) {        return buffer[index];    }}final class SequenceArray implements Array {    private final int start;    private final int stride;    private final int length;    /*...*/    @Override public int read(int index) {        return start + (stride * index);    }}Finally, we specify the operation node:@NodeChild @NodeChildabstract class ArrayReadNode extends ExpressionNode {    @Specialization   int doDefault(Array array, int index) {        return array.read(index);    }}The problem with this operation implementation is that the partial evaluator does not know which concrete type the array receiver has.Therefore, it needs to stop partial evaluation and emit a slow interface call for the read method call.This is not what we want, but we can introduce a polymorphic type cache to resolve it like this:class ArrayReadNode extends ExpressionNode {    @Specialization(guards = &quot;array.getClass() == arrayClass&quot;, limit = &quot;2&quot;)    int doCached(Array array, int index,           @Cached(&quot;array.getClass()&quot;) Class&amp;lt;? extends Array&amp;gt; arrayClass) {        return arrayClass.cast(array).read(index);    }    @Specialization(replaces = &quot;doCached&quot;)    int doDefault(Array array, int index) {        return array.read(index);    }}We solved the problem of partially evaluating the implementation, but there is no way to express the extra specialization for the constant stride and start index optimization in this solution.This is what we discovered/ solved so far:  Interfaces are existing well-known concept for polymorphism in Java.  New interface implementations can be loaded enabling modularity.  We found a convenient way to use the operations from slow-paths.  Representation types can encapsulate implementation details.But we have introduced new problems:  No representation specific profiling / caching can be performed.  Every interface call requires a polymorphic class cache on the call-site.The runnable source code for Strategy 2 can be found here.Strategy 3: Truffle LibrariesTruffle Libraries work similar to the Java interfaces.Instead of a Java interface, we create an abstract class extending the Library class and annotate it with @GenerateLibrary. We create abstract methods like with the interface, but we insert a receiver argument in the beginning, in our case of type Object.Instead of performing interface type checks we use an explicit abstract method in the library typically named is${Type}.We do this for our example:@GenerateLibrarypublic abstract class ArrayLibrary extends Library {    public boolean isArray(Object receiver) {        return false;    }    public abstract int read(Object receiver, int index);}This ArrayLibrary specifies two messages: isArray and read.At compile time, the annotation processor generates a package protected class ArrayLibraryGen.Unlike generated nodes classes, you never need to refer to this class.Instead of implementing a Java interface, we export the library using the @ExportLibrary annotation on the representation type.Message exports are specified using instance methods on the representation and can, therefore, omit the receiver argument of the library.The first representation we implement this way is the BufferArray representation:@ExportLibrary(ArrayLibrary.class)final class BufferArray {    private int length;    private int[] buffer;    /*...*/    @ExportMessage boolean isArray() {      return true;    }    @ExportMessage int read(int index) {      return buffer[index];    }}This implementation is very similar to the interface version, but in addition, we specify the isArray message.Again, the annotation processor generates the boilerplate code that implements the library abstract class.Next, we implement the sequence representation.We start by implementing it without the optimization for the start and stride value.@ExportLibrary(ArrayLibrary.class)final class SequenceArray {    private final int start;    private final int stride;    private final int length;    /*...*/    @ExportMessage int read(int index) {        return start + stride * index;    }}So far this was equivalent to the interface implementation, but with Truffle Libraries we can now also use specializations in our representations by exporting a message using a class instead of a method.The convention is that the class is named exactly like the exported message, but with the first letter upper-case.Now we implement our stride and start specialization using this mechanism:@ExportLibrary(ArrayLibrary.class)final class SequenceArray {    final int start;    final int stride;    final int length;    /*...*/    @ExportMessage static class Read {        @Specialization(guards = {&quot;seq.stride == cachedStride&quot;,                                  &quot;seq.start  == cachedStart&quot;}, limit = &quot;1&quot;)        static int doSequenceCached(SequenceArray seq, int index,                 @Cached(&quot;seq.start&quot;)  int cachedStart,                 @Cached(&quot;seq.stride&quot;) int cachedStride) {            return cachedStart + cachedStride * index;        }        @Specialization(replaces = &quot;doSequenceCached&quot;)        static int doSequence(SequenceArray seq, int index) {            return doSequenceCached(seq, index, seq.start, seq.stride);        }    }}Since the message is declared using an inner class we need to specify the receiver type.Compared to normal nodes, this class must not extend Node and its methods must be static to allow the annotation processor to generate efficient code for the library subclass.Last, we need to use the array library in our read operation.The Library API provides an annotation called @CachedLibrary that is responsible for dispatching to libraries.The array read operation now looks like this:@NodeChild @NodeChildclass ArrayReadNode extends ExpressionNode {    @Specialization(guards = &quot;arrays.isArray(array)&quot;, limit = &quot;2&quot;)    int doDefault(Object array, int index,                  @CachedLibrary(&quot;array&quot;) ArrayLibrary arrays) {        return arrays.read(array, index);    }}Similar to the type cache we have seen in Strategy 2 we specialize the library to a particular value.The first attribute of @CachedLibrary, &quot;array&quot; specifies the value the library is specialized for.A specialized library can only be used for values they were specialized for.If they are used with other values then the framework will fail with an assertion error.Instead of using the Array type as the parameter type, we use the isArray message in the guard.Using a specialized library requires us to specify the limit on the specialization.The limit specifies how many specializations of a library can be instantiated until the operation should rewrite itself to use an uncached version of the library.In the array example we have only implemented two array representations.Therefore it is impossible that the limit is exceeded.In real array implementations, we are likely to use many more representations.The limit should be set to a value that is unlikely to be exceeded in representative applications, but at the same time does not produce too much code.The uncached or slow-path version of a library can be reached by exceeding the limit of the specialization, but it can also be used manually, e.g., if the array operation needs to be invoked when no node is available.This is usually the case for parts of the language implementation that are invoked infrequently.With the interface strategy (Strategy 2), the array read operation could be used by just invoking the interface method.With Truffle libraries, we need to lookup an uncached version of the library first.Every use of @ExportLibrary generates a cached but also an uncached / slow-path library subclass.The uncached version of the exported library uses the same semantics as @GenerateUncached.Typically, as with our example, the uncached version can be derived automatically.The DSL shows an error if it needs further details on how to generate the uncached version.The uncached version of the library can be invoked like this:ArrayLibrary arrays = LibraryFactory.resolve(ArrayLibrary.class).getUncached();arrays.read(array, index);In order to decrease the verbosity of this example, it is recommended that the library class provides the following optional static utilities:@GenerateLibrarypublic abstract class ArrayLibrary extends Library {    /*...*/    public static LibraryFactory&amp;lt;ArrayLibrary&amp;gt; getFactory() {        return FACTORY;    }    public static ArrayLibrary getUncached() {        return FACTORY.getUncached();    }    private static final LibraryFactory&amp;lt;ArrayLibrary&amp;gt; FACTORY =               LibraryFactory.resolve(ArrayLibrary.class);}The verbose example from above can now be simplified as:ArrayLibrary.getUncached().readArray(array, index);The runnable source code for Strategy 3 can be found here.ConclusionIn this tutorial, we have learned that with Truffle Libraries we no longer need to compromise the modularity of representation types by creating a specialization per representation (Strategy 1) and the profiling is no longer blocked by interface calls (Strategy 2).With Truffle Libraries we now support polymorphic dispatch with type encapsulation but don’t lose the capability of using profiling/caching techniques in representation types.What to do next?      Run and debug all the examples here.        Read the interoperability migration guide, as an example of Truffle Libraries usage here.        Read the Truffle Library reference documentation here.  FAQAre there any known limitations?  Library exports currently cannot explicitly invoke their super implementation. This makes reflective implementations currently infeasible. See the example here.  Boxing elimination for return values is currently not supported. A message can only have one generic return type. Support for this is planned.  Reflection without static dependencies on the Library class is currently not supported. Support for full dynamic reflection is planned.When should I use Truffle Libraries?When to use?  If the representations are modular and cannot be enumerated for an operation (e.g., Truffle Interoperability).  If there is more than one representation of a type and one of the representations needs profiling/caching (e.g., see the motivating example).  If there is a need for a way to proxy all values of a language (e.g., for dynamic taint tracking).When not to use?  For basic types that only have one representation.  For primitive representations that require boxing elimination to speed up the interpreter. Boxing elimination is not supported with Truffle Libraries at the moment.I decided to use a Truffle Library to abstract the language specific types of my language. Should those be exposed to other languages and tools?All libraries are accessible to other languages and tools via the ReflectionLibrary.It is recommended that the language implementation documentation specifies which libraries and messages are intended for external use, and which ones may be subject to breaking changes.What happens when a new method is added to a library but a dynamically loaded implementation hasn’t been updated for it?If the library method was specified abstract then an AbstractMethodError will be thrown.Otherwise the default implementation specified by the library method body will be called.This allows to customize the error in case an abstract method is used.For example, for Truffle interoperability we often throw an UnsupportedMessageException instead of an AbstractMethodError.",

AppendCharUTF16:Append a single char to a UTF-16 string builder.  AppendCodePoint:Append a single codepoint to string builder.  AppendIntNumber:Append an integer number to a string builder.  AppendLongNumber:Append a long number to a string builder.  AppendString:Append a TruffleString to a string builder.  AppendSubstringByteIndex:Append a substring, defined by a byte-based offset and length, to a string builder.  AppendJavaStringUTF16:Append a Java String substring, defined by a char-based offset and length, to a string builder.  ToString:Create a new TruffleString from a string builder.See the below example:import com.oracle.truffle.api.dsl.Cached;import com.oracle.truffle.api.strings.TruffleString;import com.oracle.truffle.api.strings.TruffleStringBuilder;abstract static class SomeNode extends Node {    @Specialization    static TruffleString someSpecialization(            @Cached TruffleStringBuilder.AppendCharUTF16Node appendCharNode,            @Cached TruffleStringBuilder.AppendJavaStringUTF16Node appendJavaStringNode,            @Cached TruffleStringBuilder.AppendIntNumberNode appendIntNumberNode,            @Cached TruffleStringBuilder.AppendStringNode appendStringNode,            @Cached TruffleString.FromCharArrayUTF16Node fromCharArrayUTF16Node,            @Cached TruffleStringBuilder.AppendCodePointNode appendCodePointNode,            @Cached TruffleStringBuilder.ToStringNode toStringNode) {        TruffleStringBuilder sb = TruffleStringBuilder.create(TruffleString.Encoding.UTF_16);        sb = appendCharNode.execute(sb, &#39;a&#39;);        sb = appendJavaStringNode.execute(sb, &quot;abc&quot;, /* fromIndex: */ 1, /* length: */ 2);        sb = appendIntNumberNode.execute(sb, 123);        TruffleString string = fromCharArrayUTF16Node.execute(new char[]{&#39;x&#39;, &#39;y&#39;}, /* fromIndex: */ 0, /* length: */ 2);        sb = appendStringNode.execute(sb, string);        sb = appendCodePointNode.execute(sb, &#39;z&#39;);        return toStringNode.execute(sb); // string content: &quot;abc123xyz&quot;    }}EncodingsEvery TruffleString is encoded in a specific internal encoding, which is set during instantiation.TruffleString is fully optimized for the following encodings:  UTF-8  UTF-16  UTF-32  US-ASCII  ISO-8859-1  BYTESMany other encodings are supported, but not fully optimized.To use them, they must be enabled by setting needsAllEncodings = true in the Truffle language registration.A TruffleString’s internal encoding is not exposed.Instead of querying a string’s encoding, languages should pass an expectedEncoding parameter to all methods where the string’s encoding matters (which is almost all operations).This allows re-using string objects when converting between encodings, if a string is byte-equivalent in both encodings.A string can be converted to a different encoding using SwitchEncodingNode, as shown in the following example:import com.oracle.truffle.api.dsl.Cached;import com.oracle.truffle.api.strings.TruffleString;import com.oracle.truffle.api.strings.TruffleStringBuilder;abstract static class SomeNode extends Node {    @Specialization    static void someSpecialization(            @Cached TruffleString.FromJavaStringNode fromJavaStringNode,            @Cached TruffleString.ReadByteNode readByteNode,            @Cached TruffleString.SwitchEncodingNode switchEncodingNode,            @Cached TruffleString.ReadByteNode utf8ReadByteNode) {        // instantiate a new UTF-16 string        TruffleString utf16String = fromJavaStringNode.execute(&quot;foo&quot;, TruffleString.Encoding.UTF_16);        // read a byte with expectedEncoding = UTF-16.        // if the string is not byte-compatible with UTF-16, this method will throw an IllegalArgumentException        System.out.printf(&quot;%x%n&quot;, readByteNode.execute(utf16String, /* byteIndex */ 0, TruffleString.Encoding.UTF_16));        // convert to UTF-8.        // note that utf8String may be reference-equal to utf16String!        TruffleString utf8String = switchEncodingNode.execute(utf16String, TruffleString.Encoding.UTF_8);        // read a byte with expectedEncoding = UTF-8        // if the string is not byte-compatible with UTF-8, this method will throw an IllegalArgumentException        System.out.printf(&quot;%x%n&quot;, utf8ReadByteNode.execute(utf8String, /* byteIndex */ 0, TruffleString.Encoding.UTF_8));    }}Byte-equivalency between encodings is determined with string compaction on UTF-16 and UTF-32, so e.g. a compacted UTF-16 String is byte-equivalent to ISO-8859-1, and if all of its characters are in the ASCII range (see CodeRange), it is also byte-equivalent to UTF-8.To check if your code is switching encodings properly, run your unit tests with the system property truffle.strings.debug-strict-encoding-checks=true.This disables re-using string objects when switching encodings, and makes encoding checks more strict: all operations working on a single string will enforce an exact match,whereas operations working on two strings will still allow byte-equivalent re-interpretations.All TruffleString operations with more than one string parameter require the strings to be in an encoding compatible with the result encoding.So either the strings need to be in the same encoding, or the caller must ensure that both Strings are compatible with the resulting encoding.This enable callers which already know the SwitchEncodingNodes would be noops to just skip them for footprint reasons.import com.oracle.truffle.api.dsl.Cached;import com.oracle.truffle.api.strings.TruffleString;import com.oracle.truffle.api.strings.TruffleStringBuilder;abstract static class SomeNode extends Node {    @Specialization    static boolean someSpecialization(            TruffleString a,            TruffleString b,            @Cached TruffleString.SwitchEncodingNode switchEncodingNodeA,            @Cached TruffleString.SwitchEncodingNode switchEncodingNodeB,            @Cached TruffleString.EqualNode equalNode) {        TruffleString utf8A = switchEncodingNodeA.execute(a, TruffleString.Encoding.UTF_8);        TruffleString utf8B = switchEncodingNodeB.execute(b, TruffleString.Encoding.UTF_8);        return equalNode.execute(utf8A, utf8B, TruffleString.Encoding.UTF_8);    }}String PropertiesTruffleString exposes the following properties:  byteLength: The string’s length in bytes, exposed via the byteLength method.  codePointLength: The string’s length in codepoints, exposed via CodePointLengthNode.  isValid: Can be queried via IsValidNode to check whether the string is encoded correctly.  codeRange: Provides coarse information about the string’s content, exposed via GetCodeRangeNode. This property canhave the following values:          ASCII: All codepoints in this string are part of the Basic Latin Unicode block, also known as ASCII (0x00 -0x7f).      LATIN-1: All codepoints in this string are part of the ISO-8859-1 character set (0x00 - 0xff), which isequivalent to the union of the Basic Latin and the Latin-1 Supplement Unicode block. At least one codepoint in thestring is greater than 0x7f. Only applicable to ISO-8859-1, UTF-16 and UTF-32.      BMP: All codepoints in this string are part of the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) (0x0000 - 0xffff). Atleast one codepoint in the string is greater than 0xff. Only applicable to UTF-16 and UTF-32.      VALID: This string is encoded correctly, and contains at least one codepoint outside the other applicable coderanges (e.g. for UTF-8, this means there is one codepoint outside the ASCII range, and for UTF-16 this means thatthere is one codepoint outside the BMP range).      BROKEN: This string is not encoded correctly. No further information about its contents can be determined.        hashCode: The string’s hash code, exposed via HashCodeNode. The hash code is dependent on the string’s encoding;strings must always be converted to a common encoding before comparing their hash codes!See the below example how to query all properties exposed by TruffleString:import com.oracle.truffle.api.dsl.Cached;import com.oracle.truffle.api.strings.TruffleString;abstract static class SomeNode extends Node {    @Specialization    static TruffleString someSpecialization(            TruffleString string,            @Cached TruffleString.CodePointLengthNode codePointLengthNode,            @Cached TruffleString.IsValidNode isValidNode,            @Cached TruffleString.GetCodeRangeNode getCodeRangeNode,            @Cached TruffleString.HashCodeNode hashCodeNode) {        System.out.println(&quot;byte length: &quot; + string.byteLength(TruffleString.Encoding.UTF_8));        System.out.println(&quot;codepoint length: &quot; + codePointLengthNode.execute(string, TruffleString.Encoding.UTF_8));        System.out.println(&quot;is valid: &quot; + isValidNode.execute(string));        System.out.println(&quot;code range: &quot; + getCodeRangeNode.execute(string));        System.out.println(&quot;hash code: &quot; + hashCodeNode.execute(string, TruffleString.Encoding.UTF_8));    }}String Equality and ComparisonTruffleString objects should be checked for equality using EqualNode.Just like HashCodeNode, the equality comparison is sensitive to the string’s encoding, so before any comparison, strings should always be converted to a common encoding. Object#equals(Object) behaves analogous to EqualNode, but since this method does not have an expectedEncoding parameter, it will determine the string’s common encoding automatically.If the string’s encodings are not equal, TruffleString will check whether one string is binary-compatible to the other string’s encoding, and if so, match their content. Otherwise, the strings are deemed not equal, no automatic conversion is applied.Note that since TruffleString’s hashCode and equals methods are sensitive to string encoding, TruffleString objects must always be converted to a common encoding before, e.g., using them as keys in a HashMap.TruffleString also provides three comparison nodes CompareBytesNode, CompareCharsUTF16Node, and CompareIntsUTF32Node, to compare strings respectively byte-by-byte, char-by-char, and int-by-int.ConcatenationConcatenation is done via ConcatNode.This operation requires both strings to be in expectedEncoding, which is also the encoding of the resulting string. Lazy concatenation is supported via the lazy parameter.When two strings are concatenated lazily, the allocation and initialization of the new string’s internal array is delayed until another operation requires direct access to that array.Materialization of such “lazy concatenation strings” can be triggered explicitly with a MaterializeNode.This is useful to do before accessing a string in a loop, such as in the following example:import com.oracle.truffle.api.dsl.Cached;import com.oracle.truffle.api.strings.TruffleString;abstract static class SomeNode extends Node {    @Specialization    static TruffleString someSpecialization(            TruffleString utf8StringA,            TruffleString utf8StringB,            @Cached TruffleString.ConcatNode concatNode,            @Cached TruffleString.MaterializeNode materializeNode,            @Cached TruffleString.ReadByteNode readByteNode) {        // lazy concatenation        TruffleString lazyConcatenated = concatNode.execute(utf8StringA, utf8StringB, TruffleString.Encoding.UTF_8, /* lazy */ true);        // explicit materialization        TruffleString materialized = materializeNode.execute(lazyConcatenated, TruffleString.Encoding.UTF_8);        int byteLength = materialized.byteLength(TruffleString.Encoding.UTF_8);        for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; byteLength; i++) {            // string is guaranteed to be materialized here, so no slow materialization code can end up in this loop            System.out.printf(&quot;%x%n&quot;, readByteNode.execute(materialized, i, TruffleString.Encoding.UTF_8));        }    }}SubstringsSubstrings can be created via SubstringNode and SubstringByteIndexNode, which use codepoint-based and byte-based indices, respectively.Substrings can also be lazy, meaning that no new array is created for the resulting string, but instead the parent string’s array is re-used and just accessed with the offset and length passed to the substring node.Currently, a lazy substring’s internal array is never trimmed (i.e. replaced by a new array of the string’s exact length).Note that this behavior effectively creates a memory leak whenever a lazy substring is created.An extreme example where this could be problematic: given a string that is 100 megabyte in size, any lazy substring created from this string will keep the 100 megabyte array alive, even when the original string is freed by the garbage collector.Use lazy substrings with caution.Interoperability with java.lang.StringTruffleString provides FromJavaStringNode for converting a java.lang.String to TruffleString.To convert from TruffleString to java.lang.String, use a ToJavaStringNode.This node will internally convert the string to UTF-16, if necessary, and create a java.lang.String from that representation.Object#toString() is implemented using the uncached version of ToJavaStringNode and should be avoided on fast paths.import com.oracle.truffle.api.dsl.Cached;import com.oracle.truffle.api.strings.TruffleString;abstract static class SomeNode extends Node {    @Specialization    static void someSpecialization(            @Cached TruffleString.FromJavaStringNode fromJavaStringNode,            @Cached TruffleString.SwitchEncodingNode switchEncodingNode,            @Cached TruffleString.ToJavaStringNode toJavaStringNode,            @Cached TruffleString.ReadByteNode readByteNode) {        TruffleString utf16String = fromJavaStringNode.execute(&quot;foo&quot;, TruffleString.Encoding.UTF_16);        TruffleString utf8String = switchEncodingNode.execute(utf16String, TruffleString.Encoding.UTF_8);        System.out.println(toJavaStringNode.execute(utf8String));    }}TruffleString also exposes #toStringDebug() for debugging purposes.Do not use this method for anything other than debugging, as its return value is unspecified and may change at any time.Differences to java.lang.StringThe following items should be considered when switching from java.lang.String to TruffleString:  The static overhead of TruffleString instances is larger than that of java.lang.String objects. A TruffleString objectcontains 2 pointers fields, 4 int fields and 4 byte fields, which will usually result in a total object size of 40bytes (object header of 12 bytes, 4 bytes per pointer with compressed oops, 8-byte memory alignment). Ajava.lang.String object contains one pointer field, one int field and one byte field, which in the same conditionsresults in a total object size of 24 bytes. This difference in memory footprint may negatively impact some cases wherelots of small strings are generated.  TruffleString does string compaction just like java.lang.String.  If your language needs to convert strings to other encodings, e.g. UTF-8, which is very common in web applications,TruffleString can turn this operation into a no-op if the string does now contain special characters. For example,ASCII-only strings can be re-interpreted as almost any encoding, and converting an ASCII-only UTF-16 string to UTF-8is a no-op.In cases where transcoding a string is unavoidable, TruffleStrings will cache the transcoded string in the originalstring, so transcoding is only done once per string and encoding.  In order to use 3rd party libraries, TruffleString object will have to be converted to java.lang.String and back. Inorder to make this as cheap as possible, TruffleString re-uses Java String’s internal byte arrays when converting fromjava.lang.String to TruffleString, and caches Java Strings created from TruffleString objects in the object itself.  TruffleString offers additional features not present in java.lang.String:          Lazy concatenation and string views, which can significantly decrease the amount of array-copy operations yourlanguage may have to do.      String views into native memory, completely avoiding the need to copy native memory into Java arrays before usingit.      String content classification via the codeRange property, which allows specializations on strings that areASCII-only et cetera. This can reduce the complexity of some string operations significantly.        The performance of all TruffleString operations should be on par with or better than their java.lang.String-counterparts.Codepoint IteratorsTruffleString provides TruffleStringIterator as a means of iterating over a string’s codepoints.This method should be preferred over using CodePointAtIndexNode in a loop, especially on variable-width encodings such as UTF-8, since CodePointAtIndexNode may have to re-calculate the byte index equivalent of the given codepoint index on every call.See the example:import com.oracle.truffle.api.dsl.Cached;import com.oracle.truffle.api.strings.TruffleString;import com.oracle.truffle.api.strings.TruffleStringIterator;abstract static class SomeNode extends Node {    @Specialization    static void someSpecialization(            TruffleString string,            @Cached TruffleString.CreateCodePointIteratorNode createCodePointIteratorNode,            @Cached TruffleStringIterator.NextNode nextNode,            @Cached TruffleString.CodePointLengthNode codePointLengthNode,            @Cached TruffleString.CodePointAtIndexNode codePointAtIndexNode) {        // iterating over a string&#39;s codepoints using TruffleStringIterator        TruffleStringIterator iterator = createCodePointIteratorNode.execute(string, TruffleString.Encoding.UTF_8);        while (iterator.hasNext()) {            System.out.printf(&quot;%x%n&quot;, nextNode.execute(iterator));        }        // suboptimal variant: using CodePointAtIndexNode in a loop        int codePointLength = codePointLengthNode.execute(string, TruffleString.Encoding.UTF_8);        for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; codePointLength; i++) {            // performance problem: codePointAtIndexNode may have to calculate the byte index corresponding            // to codepoint index i for every loop iteration            System.out.printf(&quot;%x%n&quot;, codePointAtIndexNode.execute(string, i, TruffleString.Encoding.UTF_8));        }    }}Mutable StringsTruffleString also provides a mutable string variant called MutableTruffleString, which is also accepted in all nodes of TruffleString. MutableTruffleString is not thread-safe and allows overwriting bytes in its internal byte array or native pointer via WriteByteNode.The internal array or native pointer’s content may also be modified externally, but the corresponding MutableTruffleString must be notified of this via notifyExternalMutation().MutableTruffleString is not a Truffle interop type, and must be converted to an immutable TruffleString via TruffleString.AsTruffleString before passing a language boundary.",

          "content": "Add Logging to a Native ExecutableBy default, a native executable produced by Native Image supports logging via the java.util.logging.* API.Default Logging ConfigurationThe default logging configuration in a native executable is based on the logging.properties file found in the JDK.This file configures a java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler which will only show messages at the INFO level and above.Custom logging configuration can be loaded either at build time or at runtime as described below.If you require additional logging handlers, you must register the corresponding classes for reflection.For example, if you use java.util.logging.FileHandler then provide the following reflection configuration:{    &quot;name&quot; : &quot;java.util.logging.FileHandler&quot;,    &quot;methods&quot; : [      { &quot;name&quot; : &quot;&amp;lt;init&amp;gt;&quot;, &quot;parameterTypes&quot; : [] },    ]  }For more details, see Reflection Support.Initialize a Logger at Build TimeThe logger can be initialized at build time with a custom logging.properties configuration file, as illustrated in following example.PrerequisiteMake sure you have installed a GraalVM JDK.The easiest way to get started is with SDKMAN!.For other installation options, visit the Downloads section.  Save the following Java code into a file named LoggerBuildTimeInit.java, and compile it:     import java.io.IOException; import java.util.logging.Level; import java.util.logging.LogManager; import java.util.logging.Logger; public class LoggerBuildTimeInit {     private static final Logger LOGGER;     static {         try {             LogManager.getLogManager().readConfiguration(LoggerBuildTimeInit.class.getResourceAsStream(&quot;/logging.properties&quot;));         } catch (IOException | SecurityException | ExceptionInInitializerError ex) {             Logger.getLogger(LoggerBuildTimeInit.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, &quot;Failed to read logging.properties file&quot;, ex);         }         LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(LoggerBuildTimeInit.class.getName());     }     public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {         LOGGER.log(Level.WARNING, &quot;Danger, Will Robinson!&quot;);     } }      javac LoggerBuildTimeInit.java        Download the logging.properties resource file and save it in the same directory as LoggerBuildTimeInit.java.    Build and run a native executable:     native-image LoggerBuildTimeInit --initialize-at-build-time=LoggerBuildTimeInit     ./loggerbuildtimeinit    It should produce output that looks similar to:     WARNING: Danger, Will Robinson! [Wed May 18 17:20:39 BST 2022]    This demonstrates that the logging.properties file is processed when the executable is built. The file does not need to be included in the native executable and reduces the size of the resulting executable file.    LoggerHolder.LOGGER is also initialized at build time and is readily available at runtime, therefore improving the startup time. Unless your application needs to process a custom logging.properties configuration file at runtime, this approach is recommended.  Initialize a Logger at RuntimeThe logger can also be initialized at run time, as shown in the following example.      Save the following Java code into a file named LoggerRunTimeInit.java, and compile it:     import java.io.IOException; import java.util.logging.Level; import java.util.logging.LogManager; import java.util.logging.Logger;     public class LoggerRunTimeInit {     public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {         LogManager.getLogManager().readConfiguration(LoggerRunTimeInit.class.getResourceAsStream(&quot;/logging.properties&quot;));         Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(LoggerRunTimeInit.class.getName());         logger.log(Level.WARNING, &quot;Danger, Will Robinson!&quot;);     } }     javac LoggerRunTimeInit.java        Download the logging.properties resource file and save it in the same directory as LoggerRunTimeInit.java.        Build and run the native executable     native-image LoggerRunTimeInit -H:IncludeResources=&quot;logging.properties&quot;     ./loggerruntimeinit    It should produce output that looks similar to:     WARNING: Danger, Will Robinson! [Wed May 18 17:22:40 BST 2022]    In this case, the logging.properties file needs to be available for runtime processing and it must be included in the executable via the -H:IncludeResources=logging.properties option.

          "content": "◀BackAccelerating Java performanceGraalVM’s high-performance JIT compiler generates optimized native machine code that runs faster, produces less garbage, and uses less CPU thanks to a battery of advanced compiler optimizations and aggressive and sophisticated inlining techniques.The end results are applications that run faster and consume fewer resources—reducing cloud and infrastructure costs.Figure 1. Speedup vs OpenJDK 11The size of the speedup depends on the type of workload.On the Renaissance benchmark suite, which “contains a range of modern workloads, comprising of various popular systems, frameworks and applications made for the JVM”, Oracle GraalVM achieves a geomean speedup of 1.55x over OpenJDK 8 and similar results for OpenJDK 11.Oracle Cloud InfrastructureBy running the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Monitoring (telemetry) service on Oracle GraalVM, a 10% transaction processing rate increase was achieved along with a 25% reduction in garbage collection times, a 17% reduction in GC pause times, and a 5% reduction CPU utilization.These improvements have significant benefits for a memory intensive service that routinely processes tens of millions of data points, ingests billions of metrics, and serves millions of requests coming from an ever growing collection of OCI service offerings.Figure 2. OCI Monitoring Service Throughput (transaction per second)Quick startLower infrastructure costsHigher application performance and lower CPU and memory usage are goals every developer strives for.These goals are definitely laudable, and achieving them is easier with GraalVM, but the real value of these improvements is a reduction in the cost to run an application in production.Faster applications with lower resource requirements translate into fewer servers required to deliver a given service, and fewer servers means lower monthly cloud bills and lower capital and operating costs for on premises deployments.The math is straightforward.Even with no reduction in resource requirements, with just a ~11% improvement in throughput, 9 servers can do what required 10 before.That is one less cloud server to pay for or one less datacenter server to buy and maintain.Oracle GraalVM was the performance choice for our Dell EMC Servers. Java workload analysis and SPECjbb®2015 benchmark improving max-jOPS results by almost 8%.— Kurtis Bowman, Director of Architecture, Server Office of the CTO, Dell EMCSomething to Tweet AboutTwitter is one of the most popular social media services in the world running a platform used by millions of users around the globe daily.To keep costs down and performance up, Twitter relies on GraalVM to run core services like Tweet, Social, and News. With the efficiency of the GraalVM JIT compiler, Twitter is able to meet their throughput targets with fewer servers, resulting in significant savings.Being able to see 8–11 percent performance improvements on the same hardware without having to change the underlying code is a once-in-a-lifetime event, leading to substantial cost savings and future flexibility for Twitter.— Chris Thalinger, Staff Software Engineer, TwitterQuick startBetter performance with no code changesWhile the OpenJDK project moves forward with the 6-month release cadence, which offers time-based release model where features get in whenever they are ready, a large part of the Java ecosystem is still using Java 8 and Java 11 in production.GraalVM’s dedication to improving the Java ecosystem comes with support for those major versions which are the most popular.GraalVM includes a compatible JDK and currently offers downloads based on Java 8 or Java 11.To use GraalVM to speed up Java applications, build native executables with the Native Image feature, or incorporate libraries from other languages, you do not have to undergo complex migrations to the latest OpenJDK release.Migrating services to GraalVM mostly consists of replacing the JDK downloads or base container images with the GraalVM based ones without code changes or needing to leverage new language features!Quick startEqually excellent developer productivityOne of the best features of GraalVM is its compatibility with all the tools in the Java ecosystem.GraalVM can run Java applications offering better performance without code changes or any learning curve for developers.GraalVM fits into your workflow, being a compatible JDK it not only runs the applications you are working on, but the Java tools that help you! GraalVM works in your debugger, works with your build tools, it works within your favourite IDE, you can migrate your continuous integration environment to it, run your issue tracker on it and all other Java services you are using.You do not even have to be a Java developer! If other JVM languages are your cup of productivity, that is okay. From Kotlin, to Clojure, to Scala, GraalVM can help you run them all with excellent performance too.GraalVM merges the power of the Java ecosystem and community with a more powerful JDK distribution for the best of all worlds.Quick startSupported by industry-leading Java application frameworksSupported by industry-leading Java application frameworks, GraalVM is often cited as the most exciting innovation in the Java ecosystem.For example, the ability to compile applications into native executables with the Native Image technology revolutionises cloud deployments for Java applications.It is especially important for microservices where individual services are either neatly packed in environments constrained by memory or quickly become a major part of the cloud cost.Luckily, with GraalVM you do not have to rewrite your applications in Go to succeed in the cloud.Most major Java application and microservice frameworks are designed with GraalVM Native Image in mind or are working on adding first-class support.Micronaut, Helidon, Quarkus, or Spring Boot for microservices, PicoCLI for command line applications – whichever task you are facing, there’s a GraalVM Native Image compatible framework available to make your job easier.Quick startExpanding the Java ecosystemThe Java Virtual Machine (JVM) makes it possible to run Java programs on everything from small embedded devices to mainframes.It is a high-performance runtime that abstracts away the details of underlying hardware and operating system platforms to enable code portability.But it turns out the JVM does not actually know anything about the Java language itself as it executes programs compiled to the intermediate Java bytecode format.This means that any language that can be compiled to Java bytecode can be run on the JVM, for example, Scala, Kotlin, and Clojure.However, there are many popular languages that do not compile to Java bytecodes and cannot take advantage of the benefits provided by the JVM and the performance benefits of just-in-time compilation.But thanks to the innovative Truffle language implementation framework, GraalVM does support the execution of a number of popular programming languages including JavaScript/Node.js, Ruby, Python, and R on the JVM.There is also support for C, C++, and other languages compiled to LLVM bitcode or WebAssembly (Wasm).GraalVM and Truffle do not just make it possible to run non-Java bytecode programs on the JVM, Truffle also makes it possible for these languages to benefit from GraalVM’s advanced optimizing compiler technology to run faster and leaner — just like Java applications running on GraalVM.In all cases GraalVM Truffle languages perform as fast as, and typically many times faster, on the JVM than they do when running on their original runtimes.TruffleRuby has high potential in speed, as it is nine times faster than CRuby on optcarrot.— Carol Chen, Software Engineer, ShopifyFigure 4. GraalVM Truffle LanguagesBreaking Down WallsIn addition to GraalVM being able to run programs written in a number of languages, it is also possible to run programs that use more than one!There are thousands of useful Node.js packages, Python libraries, and Java libraries that can be used by any of the languages supported by GraalVM.This enables use cases like Java microservices that incorporate Python machine learning capabilities or JavaScript programs that use R for statistical data analysis.GraalVM’s multilingual support makes it possible for developers with different language and domain expertise to collaborate.For example, the Dutch National Police used GraalVM to integrate R code into Spring Boot web services written in Java and Scala.This allowed their data scientists to write code in R to perform data analysis while their Java and Scala developers built out services that interacted with Apache Kafka.Embedding R code in a Scala/JVM project can be an excellent way to use the powerful data processing packages accessible in R… This means you (or your Data Scientist) can use a specialized editor (e.g. RStudio) to create the R side of your functionality, while you can use your own favourite editor for the JVM side (e.g., IntelliJ).— Nathan Perdijk, Scala Developer, CodestarQuick start",

          "content": "Benchmarking TruffleRubyThis document lists the most important points to consider when benchmarking TruffleRuby.Guidelines for Benchmarking TruffleRubyWe expect anyone publishing benchmark numbers about TruffleRuby to follow these guidelines.Use Oracle GraalVMUse Oracle GraalVM (before 23.0: GraalVM Enterprise Edition), it is faster than GraalVM Community Edition overall and represents what TruffleRuby is capable of.Use ruby --version to ensure that you are running Oracle GraalVM.Use the Latest ReleaseAlways use the latest release at the time of benchmarking (so it does not misrepresent TruffleRuby by using an old release which may have known performance issues).Use the Correct Runtime ConfigurationTruffleRuby has two Runtime Configurations, Native and JVM, see this comparison.If you want to benchmark peak performance, you should use the JVM configuration.To do so, set the environment variable TRUFFLERUBYOPT=--jvm so it affects all TruffleRuby processes.You can also pass --jvm as an argument to TruffleRuby if you are sure there are no subprocesses.The Native configuration provides better startup and warmup but has slower peak performance.Of course you can also benchmark both configurations and see which one is better for what you are benchmarking.Run with Enough WarmupTruffleRuby like other runtimes with a just-in-time compiler needs some time (called warmup) to reach peak performance,because it takes time to just-in-time compile the relevant methods of the benchmark.The easiest way to check if there was enough warmup is to run the benchmark workload repeatedly inside a process and print the times of each run.The times should be very stable once it’s warmed up and conversely keep changing while it is not warmed up yet.See this documentation for more details about warmup.Consider Disabling the Global C-Extension LockOn TruffleRuby, C extensions by default use a global lock for maximum compatibility with CRuby.If you are benchmarking a multi-threaded Ruby program (e.g. Rails on a multi-threaded server), it is worth tryingTRUFFLERUBYOPT=&quot;--experimental-options --cexts-lock=false&quot;.This issue tracks a way to automatically not use the lock for extensions which do not need it.RecommendationsThese are more general recommendations about benchmarking.Avoid Benchmarking on a LaptopPerformance on laptops is very sensitive to heat, and so overall quite unstable.As an example, if the CPU gets too warm the operating system will throttle it, making the benchmark results unfair and unstable.So benchmarking should be done on on a desktop computer or server.Avoid Other Running ProcessesAs those would cause extra noise in benchmarking results.Definitely no browser, slack, IDE, etc as those use a lot of CPU.Disable Frequency ScalingCPU frequency scaling and boost generally just increases noise in benchmarking results,so it is recommended to disable them when benchmarking for more stable results.For Intel CPUs use:sudo sh -c &#39;echo 1 &amp;gt; /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo&#39;For AMD CPUs use:sudo sh -c &#39;echo 0 &amp;gt; /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost&#39;Also make sure the performance governor is used on Linux:sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performancecpupower frequency-infoDo not pin TruffleRuby to a Single CoreTruffleRuby uses multiple threads for the JIT Compiler, the GC, etc.Restricting it to a single core for benchmarking does not make sense, it would cause a lot of contention.Avoid Benchmarking on macOSmacOS’s memory management is subpar and can cause unnecessary memory swapping even when there is enough memory (e.g. it sometimes keeps terminated processes in memory needlessly).macOS’s TCP stack is also subpar, see the Passenger docs on this subject.If you have no choice but to benchmark on macOS then mention that with the resultsand ensure there is plenty free memory and no swap while benchmarking.Use vm_stat (Pages free) or top (PhysMem -&amp;gt; unused) to check the amount of free memory.Unfortunately neither of these tools show the swap usage, illustrating how difficult it is to ensure there is no swapping going on when benchmarking on macOS.Use Activity Monitor before and after benchmarking to ensure there is no swap (Swap Used) as a workaround.Activity Monitor is too heavy to be used during benchmarking.",

Build a native executable with VM inspection enabled:     native-image --enable-monitoring=jfr JFRDemo    The --enable-monitoring=jfr option enables features such as JFR that can be used to inspect the VM.    Run the executable and start recording:     ./jfrdemo -XX:StartFlightRecording=&quot;filename=recording.jfr&quot;    This command runs the application as a native executable.  The -XX:StartFlightRecording option enables the built-in Flight Recorder and starts recording to a specified binary file, recording.jfr.

Note: The feature is experimental.This guide covers the steps required to build, run, and interact with a native executable using JMX.It also shows you how to register a custom managed bean (MBean) with the JMX server and the additional steps required for it to work with Native Image.Currently Supported Features and LimitationsA JMX connection from a client to a remote MBean server is supported. The client, the server, or both may be a native executable.Only MXBeans, and standard user-defined MBeans, are supported. Dynamic and model MBeans are not supported because their management interfaces are defined at runtime. Although remote management of MXBeans is supported, not all platform MXBean functionality is implemented or is applicable in a native executable produced by Native Image. Additionally, to define and use standard MBeans, you must specify metadata configuration. This is further explained in this guide.Run a DemoPrerequisiteMake sure you have installed a GraalVM JDK.The easiest way to get started is with SDKMAN!.For other installation options, visit the Downloads section.  Save the following code to a file named SimpleJmx.java. The application main() method registers a custom MBean, then loops endlessly, so you have time to inspect the process using VisualVM.     import javax.management.MBeanServer; import javax.management.ObjectName; import java.lang.management.ManagementFactory; public class SimpleJmx {     public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception {         ObjectName objectName = new ObjectName(&quot;com.jmx.test.basic:name=simple&quot;);         Simple simple = new Simple();         simple.setName(&quot;someName&quot;);         MBeanServer server = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer();         server.registerMBean(simple, objectName);         while (true) {             Thread.sleep(1000);             System.out.println(&quot;JMX server running...&quot;);         }     }     public static interface SimpleMBean {         String getName();         void setName(String name);         String print();     }     static class Simple implements SimpleMBean {         private String name;         @Override         public String getName() {             return name;         }         @Override         public void setName(String name) {             this.name = name;         }         @Override         public String print() {             return &quot;Print output &quot; + name;         }     } }    Change your working directory to where you saved the file. Then compile the application using the GraalVM JDK:     javac SimpleJmx.java    This creates SimpleJmx.class, SimpleJmx$Simple.class, and SimpleJmx$SimpleMBean.class files.    Add dynamic proxy configuration. JMX uses dynamic proxies, a dynamic feature of Java, to access MBeans. To be able to interact with the custom SimpleMBean at runtime, you need to provide Native Image with additional dynamic proxy configuration for the MBean interface. For this, create a JSON file named proxy-config.json with the following contents:     [   { &quot;interfaces&quot;: [ &quot;SimpleJmx$SimpleMBean&quot;] } ]    Build a native executable with VM monitoring enabled and pass the JSON configuration file to native-image:     native-image --enable-monitoring=jmxserver,jmxclient,jvmstat -H:DynamicProxyConfigurationFiles=proxy-config.json SimpleJmx    The --enable-monitoring=jmxserver option enables the JMX Server feature (to accept incoming connections). The --enable-monitoring=jmxclient option enables the JMX Client feature (to make outgoing connections). Both features can be used together, comma-separated, for example, --enable-monitoring=jmxserver,jmxclient.  The jvmstat option should also be included if you want to enable discovery by VisualVM and other JVMs: --enable-monitoring=jmxserver,jmxclient,jvmstat.    Run your native executable with JMX properties:     ./simplejmx -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9996 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false    This starts the application as a simple JMX server, without password authentication or SSL using port 9996.  You can configure JMX to apply all the usual properties as shown in this guide, but this example uses a basic configuration for simplicity.  Now that the JMX server is running, inspect MBeans using VisualVM.Inspect MBeans Using VisualVM      Start VisualVM to view the managed beans in a user-friendly way.        Make sure you have the VisualVM-MBeans plugin installed (go to Tools, then Plugins, under Available Plugins, select VisualVM-MBeans, and click Install).        Go to the Applications tab and select the SimpleJmx process.From there you can select the MBeans tab.            In the MBeans tab, you can inspect the custom MBean you created earlier and perform operations on it.          To conclude, Native Image provides support for remote management using JMX.Users can enable the JMX agent in a native executable to monitor a client application running on a remote system.Related Documentation  Enabling and disabling JMX  Create Heap Dumps with VisualVM  Dynamic Proxy",

When such a module-related argument is used, the native-image tool itself is used as a module too.In addition to supporting --add-reads and --add-modules, all module related options are considered prior to scanning the module path.

Prepare the application.          Create a new Java project named “App”, for example in your favorite IDE or from your terminal, with the following structure:          | src  |   --com/  |      -- example  |          -- App.java            Add the following Java code to the src/com/example/App.java file:          package com.example;  public class App {      public static void main(String[] args) {          String str = &quot;Native Image is awesome&quot;;          String reversed = reverseString(str);          System.out.println(&quot;The reversed string is: &quot; + reversed);      }      public static String reverseString(String str) {          if (str.isEmpty())              return str;          return reverseString(str.substring(1)) + str.charAt(0);      }  }        This is a small Java application that reverses a String using recursion.              Compile the application:     javac -d build src/com/example/App.java    This produces the file App.class in the build/com/example/ directory.    Create a runnable JAR file:     jar --create --file App.jar --main-class com.example.App -C build .    It will generate a runnable JAR file, named App.jar, in the project root directory:  To view its contents, run the command jar tf App.jar.    Create a native executable:     native-image -jar App.jar    It will produce a native executable in the project root directory. The default name of the executable will be the name of the JAR file (“App” in this case). It can be customized by either providing a custom name as a last argument (for example, native-image -jar App.jar executable_name), or by using -o executable_name before or after -jar jarfile, for example: native-image -jar App.jar -o executable_name.    Run the native executable:     ./App  The default behavior of native-image is aligned with the java command which means you can pass the -jar, -cp, -m  options to build with Native Image as you would normally do with java.

          "content": "Build a Native Shared LibraryTo build a native shared library, pass the command-line argument --shared to the native-image tool, as follows:native-image &amp;lt;class name&amp;gt; --sharedTo build a native shared library from a JAR file, use the following syntax:native-image -jar &amp;lt;jarfile&amp;gt; --sharedThe resulting native shared library will have the main() method of the given Java class as its entrypoint method.If your library does not include a main() method, use the -o command-line option to specify the library name, as follows:native-image --shared -o &amp;lt;libraryname&amp;gt; &amp;lt;class name&amp;gt;native-image --shared -jar &amp;lt;jarfile&amp;gt; -o &amp;lt;libraryname&amp;gt;GraalVM makes it easy to use C to call into a native shared library. There are two primary mechanisms for calling a method (function) embedded in a native shared library: the Native Image C API and the JNI Invocation API.This guide describes how to use the Native Image C API. It consists of the following steps:  Create and compile a Java class library containing at least one entrypoint method.  Use the native-image tool to create a shared library from the Java class library.  Create and compile a C application that calls that entrypoint method in the shared library.Tips and TricksThe shared library must have at least one entrypoint method.By default, only a method named main(), originating from a public static void main() method, is identified as an entrypoint and callable from a C application.To export any other Java method:  Declare the method as static.  Annotate the method with @CEntryPoint (org.graalvm.nativeimage.c.function.CEntryPoint).  Make one of the method’s parameters of type IsolateThread or Isolate, for example, the first parameter (org.graalvm.nativeimage.IsolateThread) in the method below. This parameter provides the current thread’s execution context for the call.  Restrict your parameter and return types to non-object types. These are Java primitive types including pointers, from the org.graalvm.nativeimage.c.type package.  Provide a unique name for the method. If you give two exposed methods the same name, the native-image builder will fail with the duplicate symbol message. If you do not specify the name in the annotation, you must provide the -o &amp;lt;libraryName&amp;gt; option at build time.Below is an example of the entrypoint method:@CEntryPoint(name = &quot;function_name&quot;)static int add(IsolateThread thread, int a, int b) {    return a + b;}When the native-image tool builds a native shared library, it also generates a C header file.The header file contains declarations for the Native Image C API (which enables you to create isolates and attach threads from C code) as well as declarations for each entrypoint in the shared library.This is the C header declaration for the example above:int add(graal_isolatethread_t* thread, int a, int b);A native shared library can have an unlimited number of entrypoints, for example to implement callbacks or APIs.Run a DemoIn the following example, you create a small Java class library (containing one class), use native-image to create a shared library from the class library, and then create a small C application that uses that shared library.The C application takes a String as its argument, passes it to the shared library, and prints environment variables that contain the argument.PrerequisiteMake sure you have installed a GraalVM JDK.The easiest way to get started is with SDKMAN!.For other installation options, visit the Downloads section.      Save the following Java code to a file named LibEnvMap.java:     import java.util.Map; import org.graalvm.nativeimage.IsolateThread; import org.graalvm.nativeimage.c.function.CEntryPoint; import org.graalvm.nativeimage.c.type.CCharPointer; import org.graalvm.nativeimage.c.type.CTypeConversion; public class LibEnvMap {     //NOTE: this class has no main() method     @CEntryPoint(name = &quot;filter_env&quot;)     private static int filterEnv(IsolateThread thread, CCharPointer cFilter) {         String filter = CTypeConversion.toJavaString(cFilter);         Map&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt; env = System.getenv();         int count = 0;         for (String envName : env.keySet()) {             if(!envName.contains(filter)) continue;             System.out.format(&quot;%s=%s%n&quot;,                             envName,                             env.get(envName));             count++;         }         return count;     } }    Notice how the method filterEnv() is identified as an entrypoint using the @CEntryPoint annotation and the method is given a name as a argument to the annotation.    Compile the Java code and build a native shared library, as follows:     javac LibEnvMap.java     native-image -o libenvmap --shared     It produces the following artifacts:     -------------------------------------------------- Produced artifacts: /demo/graal_isolate.h (header) /demo/graal_isolate_dynamic.h (header) /demo/libenvmap.dylib (shared_lib) /demo/libenvmap.h (header) /demo/libenvmap_dynamic.h (header) ==================================================    If you work with C or C++, use these header files directly. For other languages, such as Java, use the function declarations in the headers to set up your foreign call bindings.    Create a C application, main.c, in the same directory containing the following code:     #include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt; #include &quot;libenvmap.h&quot; int main(int argc, char **argv) { if (argc != 2) {     fprintf(stderr, &quot;Usage: %s &amp;lt;filter&amp;gt;n&quot;, argv[0]);     exit(1); } graal_isolate_t *isolate = NULL; graal_isolatethread_t *thread = NULL; if (graal_create_isolate(NULL, &amp;amp;isolate, &amp;amp;thread) != 0) {     fprintf(stderr, &quot;initialization errorn&quot;);     return 1; } printf(&quot;Number of entries: %dn&quot;, filter_env(thread, argv[1])); graal_tear_down_isolate(thread); }    The statement #include &quot;libenvmap.h&quot; loads the native shared library.    Compile main.c using the clang compiler available on your system:     clang -I ./ -L ./ -l envmap -Wl,-rpath ./ -o main main.c     It creates an executable file main.    Run the C application by passing a string as an argument. For example:     ./main USER    It correctly prints out the name and value of the matching environment variable(s).  The advantage of using the Native Image C API is that you can determine what your API will look like. The restriction is that your parameter and return types must be non-object types.If you want to manage Java objects from C, you should consider JNI Invocation API.Related Documentation  Embedding Truffle Languages– a blog post by Kevin Menard where he compares both mechanisms for exposing Java methods.

This is an alternative option to staticly linking everything. Also, depending on the user’s code, it may link libstdc+ and libgcc.This approach is ideal for deployment on a distroless container image.  Note: This currently only works when linked against libc.This guide shows how you can take advantage of Native Image linking options including fully dynamic, fully static, and mostly static (except libc) to generate an executable ideal for your deployment scenario.Prerequisites and PreparationThe following prerequisites should be met:  Linux AMD64 operating system  GraalVM distribution for Java 21 of higher  A 64-bit musl toolchain, make, and configure  The latest zlib library      Install a GraalVM JDK.The easiest way to get started is with SDKMAN!.For other installation options, visit the Downloads section.

Ensure the directory named $TOOLCHAIN_DIR/bin is present on your PATH.To verify this, run the following command:    x86_64-linux-musl-gcc    You should see output similar to the following:    x86_64-linux-musl-gcc: fatal error: no input filescompilation terminated.    Compile the file:     javac EnvMap.java    Build a static native executable by running this command:     native-image --static --libc=musl EnvMap    This produces a native executable with statically linked system libraries. You can pass other arguments before a class or JAR file.  Build a Mostly-Static Native ExecutableWith GraalVM Native Image you can build a mostly-static native executable that statically links everything except libc. Statically linking all your libraries except libc ensures your application has all the libraries it needs to run on any Linux libc-based distribution.To build a mostly-static native executable, use this command:native-image -H:+StaticExecutableWithDynamicLibC [other arguments] &amp;lt;Class&amp;gt;To build a mostly-static native executable for the above EnvMap demo, run:native-image -H:+StaticExecutableWithDynamicLibC EnvMapThis produces a native executable that statically links all involved libraries (including JDK shared libraries) except for libc. This includes zlib. Also, depending on the user’s code, it may link libstdc+ and libgcc. One way to check what dynamic libraries your application depends on is to run ldd with the native executable, for example, ldd helloworld.Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat is the recommended base container image for deploying a static or mostly-static native executable?A fully static native executable gives you the most flexibility to choose a base container image—it can run on anything including a FROM scratch image.A mostly-static native executable requires a container image that provides libc, but has no additional requirements.In both cases, choosing the base container image generally depends on your native executable’s specific requirements.Related Documentation  Tiny Java Containers demo shows how a simple Java application and a simple web server can be compiled to produce very small Docker container images using various lightweight base images.

          "title": "Configure Native Image with the Tracing Agent",
          "content": "Configure Native Image with the Tracing AgentTo build a native executable for a Java application that uses Java reflection, dynamic proxy objects, JNI, or class path resources, you should either provide the native-image tool with JSON-formatted configuration files or pre-compute metadata in the code.You can create configuration file(s) by hand, but a more convenient approach is to generate the configuration using the Tracing agent (from now on, the agent). This guide demonstrates how to configure native-image with the agent. The agent generates the configuration for you automatically when you run an application on a JVM.To learn how to build a native executable with the metadata pre-computed in the code, see the documentation.The example application in this guide uses Java reflection. The native-image tool only partially detects application elements that are accessed using the Java Reflection API. So, you need to provide it with details about reflectively accessed classes, methods, and fields.Example with No ConfigurationThe following application demonstrates the use of Java reflection.PrerequisiteMake sure you have installed a GraalVM JDK.The easiest way to get started is with SDKMAN!.For other installation options, visit the Downloads section.  Save the following source code in a file named ReflectionExample.java:     import java.lang.reflect.Method;     class StringReverser {     static String reverse(String input) {         return new StringBuilder(input).reverse().toString();     } }     class StringCapitalizer {     static String capitalize(String input) {         return input.toUpperCase();     } }     public class ReflectionExample {     public static void main(String[] args) throws ReflectiveOperationException {         if (args.length == 0) {             System.err.println(&quot;You must provide the name of a class, the name of its method and input for the method&quot;);             return;         }         String className = args[0];         String methodName = args[1];         String input = args[2];             Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; clazz = Class.forName(className);         Method method = clazz.getDeclaredMethod(methodName, String.class);         Object result = method.invoke(null, input);         System.out.println(result);     } }    This Java application uses command-line arguments to determine the operation to be performed.    Compile the example and then run each command below.     javac ReflectionExample.java     java ReflectionExample StringReverser reverse &quot;hello&quot;     java ReflectionExample StringCapitalizer capitalize &quot;hello&quot;    The output of each command should be &quot;olleh&quot; and &quot;HELLO&quot;, respectively. (An exception is thrown if you provide any other string to identify the class or method.)    Create a native executable, as follows:     native-image --no-fallback ReflectionExample          NOTE: The --no-fallback option to native-image causes the utility to fail if it can not create an executable file.        Run the resulting native executable, using the following command:     ./reflectionexample StringReverser reverse &quot;hello&quot;    You should see an exception, similar to:     Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: StringReverser     at java.lang.Class.forName(DynamicHub.java:1338)     at java.lang.Class.forName(DynamicHub.java:1313)     at ReflectionExample.main(ReflectionExample.java:25)    This shows that, from its static analysis, the native-image tool was unable to determine that class StringReverser is used by the application and therefore did not include it in the native executable.  Example with ConfigurationThe following steps demonstrate how to use the agent, and its output, to create a native executable that relies on reflection and requires configuration.  Create a directory named META-INF/native-image/ in the working directory:     mkdir -p META-INF/native-image    Run the application with the agent enabled, as follows:     java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=META-INF/native-image ReflectionExample StringReverser reverse &quot;hello&quot;    This command creates a file named reflect-config.json containing the name of the class StringReverser and its reverse() method.     [     {     &quot;name&quot;:&quot;StringReverser&quot;,     &quot;methods&quot;:[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;reverse&quot;,&quot;parameterTypes&quot;:[&quot;java.lang.String&quot;] }]     } ]    Build a native executable:     native-image ReflectionExample    The native-image tool automatically uses configuration files in the META-INF/native-image/ directory. However, we recommend that the META-INF/native-image/ directory is on the class path, either via a JAR file or using the -cp option. (This avoids confusion for IDE users where a directory structure is defined by the IDE itself.)    Test your executable.     ./reflectionexample StringReverser reverse &quot;hello&quot; olleh     ./reflectionexample StringCapitalizer capitalize &quot;hello&quot;    You should see again an exception, similar to:     Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: StringCapitalizer     at java.lang.Class.forName(DynamicHub.java:1338)     at java.lang.Class.forName(DynamicHub.java:1313)     at ReflectionExample.main(ReflectionExample.java:25)    Neither the tracing agent nor the native-image tool can ensure that the configuration file is complete. The agent observes and records which program elements are accessed using reflection when you run the program.  In this case, the native-image tool has not been configured to include references to class StringCapitalizer.    Update the configuration to include class StringCapitalizer. You can manually edit the reflect-config.json file or re-run the tracing agent to update the existing configuration file using the config-merge-dir option, as follows:     java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-merge-dir=META-INF/native-image ReflectionExample StringCapitalizer capitalize &quot;hello&quot;    This command updates the reflect-config.json file to include the name of the class StringCapitalizer and its capitalize() method.     [     {     &quot;name&quot;:&quot;StringCapitalizer&quot;,     &quot;methods&quot;:[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;capitalize&quot;,&quot;parameterTypes&quot;:[&quot;java.lang.String&quot;] }]     },     {     &quot;name&quot;:&quot;StringReverser&quot;,     &quot;methods&quot;:[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;reverse&quot;,&quot;parameterTypes&quot;:[&quot;java.lang.String&quot;] }]     } ]    Rebuild the native executable and run it.     native-image ReflectionExample     ./reflectionexample StringCapitalizer capitalize &quot;hello&quot;    The application should now work as intended.

          "content": "Chrome DebuggerGraalVM supports debugging of guest language applications and provides a built-in implementation of the Chrome DevTools Protocol.This allows you to attach compatible debuggers such as Chrome Developer Tools to GraalVM.To debug guest language applications, pass the --inspect option to the command line launcher, as in the following example with a Node.js HelloWorld program:var http = require(&#39;http&#39;);var server = http.createServer(function (request, response) {  response.writeHead(200, {&quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;text/plain&quot;});  response.end(&quot;Hello World!n&quot;);});server.listen(8000);console.log(&quot;Server running at http://localhost:8000/&quot;);  Save this program as HelloWorld.js and then run:    $JAVA_HOME/bin/node --inspect HelloWorld.jsDebugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9229/SBqxI5YIqtREaDrXkFr8hLE0HL1AfKx8TjkI8qPMq2sFor help, see: https://www.graalvm.org/tools/chrome-debuggerE.g. in Chrome open: devtools://devtools/bundled/js_app.html?ws=127.0.0.1:9229/SBqxI5YIqtREaDrXkFr8hLE0HL1AfKx8TjkI8qPMq2s        Navigate to http://localhost:8000/ in your browser to launch the node application.        Open the devtools:... link in a separate Chrome browser tab.        Navigate to the HelloWorld.js file and submit a breakpoint at line 4.    Refresh the node.js app and you can see the breakpoint hit.Now you can inspect the stack, variables, evaluate variables, and selected expressions in a tooltip, and so on. By hovering your cursor over the response variable, for instance, you can inspect its properties, as seen in the screenshot below:Consult the JavaScript Debugging Reference for details on Chrome DevTools debugging features.This debugging process applies to all guest languages that GraalVM supports.Other languages such as R and Ruby can be debugged as easily as JavaScript, including stepping through language boundaries during guest language interoperability.Inspect OptionsNode LauncherThe Node.js runtime of GraalVM accepts the same options as node.js built on the V8 JavaScript engine, such as:--inspect[=[host:]&amp;lt;port number&amp;gt;]This enables the inspector agent and listens on port 9229 by default. To listen on a different port, specify the optional port number:--inspect-brk[=[host:]&amp;lt;port number&amp;gt;]This applies to the node launcher only.Other Language LaunchersOther guest language launchers such as js, python, Rscript, ruby, lli, and polyglot accept the --inspect[=[host:]&amp;lt;port number&amp;gt;] option, but suspend on the first line of the application code by default.--inspect.Suspend=(true|false)This disables the initial suspension if you specify --inspect.Suspend=false.Additional Common Inspect OptionsAll launchers also accept the following additional options:  --inspect.Path=&amp;lt;path&amp;gt; allows users to specify a custom path that generates the connection URL. Note: any website opened in your browser that has knowledge of this URL can connect to the debugger. A predictable path can thus be abused by a malicious website to execute arbitrary code on your computer, even if you are behind a firewall. Therefore the path is randomly generated by default.  --inspect.SourcePath=&amp;lt;source path&amp;gt; specifies a list of directories or ZIP/JAR files representing the source path. When the inspected application contains relative references to source files, their content is loaded from locations resolved with respect to this source path. It is useful during LLVM debugging, for instance.The paths are delimited by : on UNIX systems and by ; on MS Windows.  --inspect.Secure=(true|false) when true, use TLS/SSL to secure the debugging protocol. Besides changing the WS(web socket) protocol to WSS, the HTTP endpoint that serves metadata about the debuggeeis also changed to HTTPS. This is not compatible, e.g., with achrome://inspect page, which is not able to provide the debuggeeinformation and launch the debugger. Launch debugging via the printed WSS URL directly. Use the standard javax.net.ssl.* system options to provide information about keystore with the TLS/SSL encryption keys, or the following options:          --inspect.KeyStore - keystore file path      --inspect.KeyStoreType - keystore file type (defaults to JKS)      --inspect.KeyStorePassword - keystore password      --inspect.KeyPassword - password for recovering keys, if it’s different from the keystore password        --inspect.WaitAttached=(true|false) when true, no guest language source code is executed until the inspector client is attached. Unlike --inspect.Suspend=true, the execution is resumed rightafter the client is attached. This assures that no execution is missed by theinspector client. It is false by default.Advanced Debug OptionsThe following options are for language experts and language developers:  --inspect.Initialization=(true|false) when true, this option inspects the language initialization phase. When initial suspension is active, this suspends at the beginning of language initialization, not necessarily at the beginning of the application code. It is false by default.  --inspect.Internal=(true|false)  when true, internal sources are inspected as well. Internal sources may provide language implementation details. It is false by default.Programmatic Launch of Inspector BackendEmbedders can provide the appropriate inspector options to the Engine/Context to launch the inspector backend.The following code snippet provides an example of a possible launch:import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;class DebuggerSample {    public static void main(String... args) {        String port = &quot;4242&quot;;        String path = java.util.UUID.randomUUID().toString();        Context context = Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;)                    .option(&quot;inspect&quot;, port)                    .option(&quot;inspect.Path&quot;, path)                    .build();        String hostAdress = &quot;localhost&quot;;        String url = String.format(                    &quot;chrome-devtools://devtools/bundled/js_app.html?ws=%s:%s/%s&quot;,                    hostAdress, port, path);    }}When running on OpenJDK, the following Maven dependency must be declared to use the Chrome Inspector tool from an embedding:&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.tools&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;chromeinspector&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;${graalvm.version}&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;The Chrome Inspector tool is always available as a tool on GraalVM.

          "title": "Code Coverage Command Line Tool",
          "content": "Code Coverage Command Line ToolGraalVM provides a code coverage command line tool that lets users record and analyze the source code coverage of a particular execution of code.Code coverage, as a percentage of source code lines, functions, or statements covered, is an important metric for understanding a particular source code execution, and is commonly associated with test quality (test coverage).Providing a visual coverage overview for individual lines of code shows the developer which code paths are covered and which are not, giving insight into the character of the execution which can, for example, inform further testing efforts.The example application below will be used to demonstrate GraalVM’s code coverage capabilities.This application defines a getPrime function that calculates the n-th prime using a basic prime number calculator based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.It also has a somewhat naive cache of the first 20 prime numbers.  Copy the following code into a new file named primes.js:class AcceptFilter {    accept(n) {        return true    }}class DivisibleByFilter {    constructor(number, next) {        this.number = number;        this.next = next;    }    accept(n) {        var filter = this;        while (filter != null) {            if (n % filter.number === 0) {                    return false;            }            filter = filter.next;        }        return true;    }}class Primes {    constructor() {        this.number = 2;        this.filter = new AcceptFilter();    }    next() {        while (!this.filter.accept(this.number)) {            this.number++;        }        this.filter = new DivisibleByFilter(this.number, this.filter);        return this.number;    }}function calculatePrime(n) {    var primes = new Primes();    var primesArray = [];    for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; n; i++) {        primesArray.push(primes.next());    }    return primesArray[n-1];}function getPrime(n) {    var cache = [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71];    var n = arguments[0];    if (n &amp;gt; cache.length) { return calculatePrime(n); }    return cache[n-1];}// TESTSconsole.assert(getPrime(1) == 2);console.assert(getPrime(10) == 29);Notice that the last couple of lines are assertions to be treated as unit tests.      Run js primes.js. The example application should print no output, since all the assertions pass. But how well do the assertions test the implementation?    Run js primes.js --coverage to enable code coverage. The code coverage tool should print output for the example application as follows:    js primes.js --coverage--------------------------------------------------------Code coverage histogram.Shows what percent of each element was covered during execution-------------------------------------------------------- Path               |  Statements |    Lines |    Roots-------------------------------------------------------- /path/to/primes.js |      20.69% |   26.67% |   22.22%--------------------------------------------------------    The tracer prints a coverage histogram for each source file.You can see that statement coverage is roughly 20%, line coverage is roughly 26%, and root coverage (the term “root” covers functions, methods, etc.) is 22.22%.This tells your that our simple tests are not particularly good at exercising the source code.Next you will figure out which parts of the code are not covered.    Run js primes.js --coverage --coverage.Output=detailed. Prepare for a somewhat verbose output.Specifying the output as detailed will print all the source code lines with acoverage annotation at the beginning. Due to potentially large output, it isrecommended to combine this output mode with the --coverage.OutputFile optionwhich prints the output directly to a file. The output for our exampleapplication is as follows:js primes.js --coverage --coverage.Output=detailed--------------------------------------------------------Code coverage per line of code and what percent of each element was covered during execution (per source)  + indicates the line is covered during execution  - indicates the line is not covered during execution  p indicates the line is part of a statement that was incidentally covered during execution    e.g. a not-taken branch of a covered if statement-------------------------------------------------------- Path               |  Statements |    Lines |    Roots /path/to/primes.js |      20.69% |   26.67% |   22.22%  class AcceptFilter {      accept(n) {-         return true      }  }  class DivisibleByFilter {      constructor(number, next) {-         this.number = number;-         this.next = next;      }      accept(n) {-         var filter = this;-         while (filter != null) {-             if (n % filter.number === 0) {-                     return false;-             }-             filter = filter.next;          }-         return true;      }  }  class Primes {      constructor() {-         this.number = 2;-         this.filter = new AcceptFilter();      }      next() {-         while (!this.filter.accept(this.number)) {-             this.number++;          }-         this.filter = new DivisibleByFilter(this.number, this.filter);-         return this.number;      }  }  function calculatePrime(n) {-     var primes = new Primes();-     var primesArray = [];-     for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; n; i++) {-         primesArray.push(primes.next());      }-     return primesArray[n-1];  }  function getPrime(n) {+     var cache = [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71];+     var n = arguments[0];p     if (n &amp;gt; cache.length) { return calculatePrime(n); }+     return cache[n-1];  }  // TESTS+ console.assert(getPrime(1) == 2);+ console.assert(getPrime(10) == 29);--------------------------------------------------------As the legend at the beginning of the output explains, lines that are covered by the execution are preceded with a +.Lines not covered by the execution are preceded with a -.Lines that are covered partially are preceded with p (e.g., when an if statement is covered but only one branch is taken, consider the other bench to be incidentally covered).Looking at the output you can see that the calculatePrime function and all its calls are never executed. Looking again at the assertions and the getPrimefunction, it becomes clear that our tests always hit the cache.Thus most of the code is never executed. You can improve on that.  Add console.assert(getPrime(30) == 113); to the end of the primes.js file and run js primes.js --coverage. Since the new assertion added callsgetPrime with 30 (our cache only has 20 entries) the coverage will look like this:js primes.js --coverage-------------------------------------------------------Code coverage histogram.

Copy the following code into a new file named nodeapp.js:const express = require(&#39;express&#39;)const app = express()const port = 3000app.get(&#39;/&#39;, (req, res) =&amp;gt; {  res.send(&#39;Hello World!&#39;)})app.get(&#39;/neverCalled&#39;, (req, res) =&amp;gt; {  res.send(&#39;You should not be here&#39;)})app.get(&#39;/shutdown&#39;, (req, res) =&amp;gt; {  process.exit();})app.listen(port, () =&amp;gt; console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}!`))  Install the express module dependency:    $JAVA_HOME/bin/npm install express        Launch Visual Studio Code and install a code coverage plugin that supports lcov.The Code Coverage Highlighter is used for this example, but other plugins should work similarly.    Run the nodeapp.js file with coverage enabled and configured:    $JAVA_HOME/bin/node --coverage --coverage.Output=lcov --coverage.OutputFile=coverage/lcov.info nodeapp.js  Note that the Code Coverage Highlighter plugin looks for the lcov.info file in the coverage directory by default, so direct the output of the code coverage tool there.      Visit localhost:3000/ in your browser, then visit localhost:3000/shutdown to close the app.        Open Visual Studio Code, then open the folder containing the nodeapp.js file and coverage directory and you should be greeted with an image similar to the following:  If you wish to integrate the data gathered by the GraalVM code coverage tool with your own visualisation, the --coverage.Output=json option results in the output being a JSON file with the raw data gathered by the tracker.",

We run a comprehensive set of language specification testson each push to any of the GraalVM language repositories. Sometimes those test suites areincomplete, in which case we work with third parties to improve the overall ecosystem.We also run regular tests against a subset of popular packages for each of the supportedGraalVM languages. If you are interested in checking if your package is supported, use oneof the two tools below. Specify the name of the module or package you are interested in, or drop in your package.json, Gemfile.lock, or other files containing the list of your dependencies.Note that all the processing is done on the client-side in the browser, no information is sent to any servers.We run tests on the modules from their respective repositories: PyPI and the standard library for Python, NPM for node modules, RubyGems for Ruby gems. We try to download the module and run its tests. If the tests pass, the compatibility checker will report the amount of passed tests for the module, for example “100.00% tests pass”. Please use the compatibility checker as the initial tool to check the compatibility and assess it further yourself. In general, unless the tests clearly fail, there is a good chance the module will run on GraalVM.            Quickly check if a Python package or standard library module, an NPM module, or a Ruby gem is compatible with GraalVM.                                                            &amp;times;                        Check!

          "title": "Compatibility",
          "content": "CompatibilityTruffleRuby aims to be fully compatible with the standard implementation ofRuby, MRI, version 3.2.2, including C extensions.TruffleRuby is still in development, so it is not 100% compatible yet.TruffleRuby can run Rails and is compatible with many gems, including C extensions.TruffleRuby passes around 97% of ruby/spec,more than any other alternative Ruby implementation.Any incompatibility with MRI is considered a bug, except for rare cases detailed below.If you find an incompatibility with MRI, please report it.TruffleRuby tries to match the behavior of MRI as much as possible.In a few limited cases, TruffleRuby is deliberately incompatible with MRI in order to provide a greater capability.IdentificationTruffleRuby defines these constants for identification:  RUBY_ENGINE is &#39;truffleruby&#39;.  RUBY_VERSION is the compatible MRI version.  RUBY_REVISION is the full git commit hash used to build TruffleRuby (similar to MRI 2.7+).  RUBY_RELEASE_DATE is the git commit date.  RUBY_PATCHLEVEL is always zero.  RUBY_ENGINE_VERSION is the TruffleRuby version, or 0.0- and the Git commit hash if your build is not part of a TruffleRuby release.In the C API, the preprocessor macro TRUFFLERUBY is defined, which can be checked with #ifdef TRUFFLERUBY.Ruby 3.x FeaturesMost features of Ruby 3.2 and earlier are supported in TruffleRuby.However some features are not yet implemented.See the following issues for details:  Ruby 3.2 features  Ruby 3.1 features  Ruby 3.0 features  Pattern Matching  Endless methodsFeatures Entirely MissingContinuations and callccContinuations are obsolete in MRI, and Fibers are recommended instead.Continuations and callcc are unlikely to ever be implemented in TruffleRuby, as their semantics fundamentally do not match the JVM architecture.ForkYou cannot fork the TruffleRuby interpreter.The feature is unlikely to ever be supported when running on the JVM but could be supported in the future in the native configuration.The correct and portable way to test if fork is available is:Process.respond_to?(:fork)Standard librariesThe following standard libraries are unsupported:  continuation: obsolete in MRI  debug: it relies on RubyVM::InstructionSequence, use the VSCode extension or --inspect instead  io/console: partially implemented  io/wait: partially implemented  pty: could be implemented in the futureTruffleRuby provides its own backend implementation for the ffi gem, similar to JRuby.This should be completely transparent and behave the same as on MRI.The implementation should be fairly complete and passes all the specs of the ffi gem except for some rarely-used corner cases.Internal MRI functionalityRubyVM is not intended for users and is not implemented.Features with Major DifferencesThreads run in parallelIn MRI, threads are scheduled concurrently but not in parallel.In TruffleRuby threads are scheduled in parallel.As in JRuby and Rubinius, you are responsible for correctly synchronising access to your own shared mutable data structures, and TruffleRuby will be responsible for correctly synchronising the state of the interpreter.Fibers do not have the same performance characteristics as in MRIMost use cases of fibers rely on them being easy and cheap to start up, and with low memory overheads.In TruffleRuby, fibers are currently implemented using operating system threads, so they have the same performance characteristics as Ruby threads.This will be addressed once the Loom project becomes stable and available in JVM releases.Some classes marked as internal will be differentMRI provides some classes that are described in the documentation as being available only on MRI (CRuby).These classes are implemented if it is practical to do so, but this is not always the case. For example, RubyVM is not available.RegexpRegexp instances are always immutable in TruffleRuby.In CRuby 3.1, all literal Regexp are immutable, but non-literal are still mutable.This limitation means that one cannot define singleton methods on a Regexp instance, and cannot create instances of subclasses of Regexp on TruffleRuby.Features with Subtle DifferencesCommand line switchesThe -y, --yydebug, --dump=, and --debug-frozen-string-literal switches are ignored with a warning as they are unsupported development tools.Programs passed in -e arguments with magic-comments must have an encoding that is UTF-8 or a subset of UTF-8, as the JVM has already decoded arguments by the time we get them.The --jit option and the jit feature have no effect on TruffleRuby and warn. The GraalVM compiler is always used when available.Strings have a maximum bytesize of 231-1Ruby Strings are represented as a Java byte[].The JVM enforces a maximum array size of 231-1 (by storing the size in a 32-bit signed int), and therefore Ruby Strings cannot be longer than 231-1 bytes.That is, Strings must be smaller than 2GB. This is the same restriction as JRuby.A possible workaround could be to use natively-allocated strings, but it would be a large effort to support every Ruby String operation on native strings.Strings in UTF-16 and UTF-32 encodingTruffleRuby does not support UTF-16 strings with an odd number of bytes (in native endianness). Similarly, with UTF-32 it needs to be a multiple of 4. This is necessary for optimizations, compression, invariants, etc.Threads detect interrupts at different pointsTruffleRuby threads may detect that they have been interrupted at different points in the program compared to where they would on MRI.In general, TruffleRuby seems to detect an interrupt sooner than MRI.JRuby and Rubinius are also different from MRI; the behavior is not documented in MRI, and it is likely to change between MRI versions, so it is not recommended to depend on interrupt points.Polyglot standard I/O streamsIf you use standard I/O streams provided by the Polyglot engine, via the experimental --polyglot-stdio option, reads and writes to file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 will be redirected to these streams.That means that other I/O operations on these file descriptors, such as isatty, may not be relevant for where these streams actually end up, and operations like dup may lose the connection to the polyglot stream.For example, if you $stdout.reopen, as some logging frameworks do, you will get the native standard-out, not the polyglot out.Also, I/O buffer drains, writes on I/O objects with sync set, and write_nonblock will not retry the write on EAGAIN and EWOULDBLOCK, as the streams do not provide a way to detect this.Error messagesError message strings will sometimes differ from MRI, as these are not generally covered by the Ruby Spec Suite or tests.SignalsFirst, KILL and STOP can never be trapped, per POSIX (man 2 signal).Some signals are reserved on CRuby, and they are also reserved on TruffleRuby, because trapping those would cause all sorts of problems: SEGV, BUS, ILL, FPE and VTALRM.When using the native configuration, TruffleRuby allows trapping all the same signals that MRI does.Consequently, any signal handling code that runs on MRI can run on TruffleRuby without modification in the native configuration.However, when run on the JVM, TruffleRuby is unable to trap QUIT, as this signal is reserved by the JVM.In such a case trap(:QUIT) {} will raise an ArgumentError.Any code that relies on being able to trap this signal will need to fall back to another available signal.When TruffleRuby is run as part of a polyglot application, any signals that are handled by another language become unavailable for TruffleRuby to trap.GC statisticsTruffleRuby provides similar GC.stat statistics to MRI, but not all statistics are available, and some statistics may be approximations. Use GC.stat.keys to see which are provided with real or approximate values. Missing values will return 0.Caller locationsUsing Kernel#caller_locations or Thread.each_caller_location might contain engine specific location objects and/orpaths. This is expected and should be filtered in application code where necessary.The enumerator returned by Thread.to_enum(:each_caller_location) is not supporting iteration with .next. In CRubythis raises a StopIteration, while in TruffleRuby it iterates on an undetermined (related to where and how .next iscalled) call stack. It is not recommended to use this in any circumstance (neither CRuby nor TruffleRuby).Features with Very Low PerformanceObjectSpaceObjectSpace#each_object is implemented but is fairly slow due to needing to iterate the whole heap and essentially doing the equivalent of a GC marking phase.ObjectSpace#trace_object_allocations_start slows down all allocations, similar to the behavior on CRuby.Using most methods on ObjectSpace will temporarily lower the performance of your program.Using them in test cases and other similar ‘offline’ operations is fine, but you probably do not want to use them in the inner loop of your production application.set_trace_funcUsing set_trace_func will temporarily lower the performance of your program.As with ObjectSpace, it is recommended that you do not use this in the inner loop of your production application.BacktracesThrowing exceptions and other operations which need to create a backtrace are in general slower than on MRI.This is because TruffleRuby needs to undo optimizations that have been applied to run your Ruby code fast in order to recreate the backtrace entries.It is not recommended to use exceptions for control flow on any implementation of Ruby anyway.To help alleviate this problem, backtraces are automatically disabled in cases where we can detect that they will not be used.C Extension CompatibilityIdentifiers may be macros or functionsIdentifiers which are normally macros may be functions, functions may be macros, and global variables may be macros.This may cause problems where they are used in a context which relies on a particular implementation (e.g., taking theaddress of it, assigning to a function pointer variable, and using defined() to check if a macro exists).These issues should all be considered bugs and be fixed.Please report these cases.rb_scan_argsrb_scan_args only supports up to 10 pointers.rb_funcallrb_funcall only supports up to 15 arguments.mark functions of RDATA and RTYPEDDATAThe mark functions of RDATA and RTYPEDDATA are not called during garbage collection, but called periodically.The information about objects is cached as they are assigned to structs, and TruffleRuby periodically runs all mark functions when the cache has become full to represent those object relationships in a way that the garbage collector willunderstand.The process should behave identically to MRI.Compatibility with JRubyRuby to Java interoperabilityTruffleRuby does not support the same interoperability interface to Java as JRuby does.TruffleRuby provides an alternate polyglot API for interoperating with multiple languages, including Java, instead.Java to Ruby interopCalling Ruby code from Java is supported by theGraalVM Polyglot API.Java extensionsUsing Java extensions written for JRuby is not supported.Features Not Yet Supported in Native ConfigurationRunning TruffleRuby in the native configuration is mostly the same as runningon the JVM. There are differences in resource management, as both VMs usedifferent garbage collectors, but functionality-wise, they are essentially onpar with one another.Java Interoperability With the Native ConfigurationJava interoperability works in the native configuration but requires more setup.By default, only some array classes are available in the image for Java interoperability.You can add more classes by compiling a native image including TruffleRuby.See here for more details.Spec Completeness“How many specs are there?” is not a question with an easy, precise answer. Thenumber of specs varies for the different versions of the Ruby language, differentplatforms, and different versions of the specs.The specs for the standard library and C extension API are alsovery uneven and can give misleading results.This blog postsummarizes how many specs TruffleRuby passes.",

          "title": "Graal Compiler",
          "content": "Graal Compiler  Compiler Advantages  Graph Compilation  Ahead-of-time Compilation  Compiler Operating Modes  Diagnostic DataThe Graal compiler is a dynamic just-in-time (JIT) compiler, written in Java, that transforms bytecode into machine code.The Graal compiler integrates with the Java HotSpot VM, which supports a compatible version of the JVM Compiler Interface (JVMCI).JVMCI is a privileged, low-level interface to the JVM, enabling a compiler written in Java to be used by the JVM as a dynamic compiler (see JEP 243).It can read metadata from the VM, such as method bytecode, and install machine code into the VM.GraalVM includes a version of the HotSpot JVM that supports JVMCI.Compiler AdvantagesThe Graal compiler provides optimized performance for programs running on the JVM through unique approaches to code analysis and optimization.It includes multiple optimization algorithms (called “Phases”), like aggressive inlining, polymorphic inlining, and others. Find some of the platform-independent compiler optimizations in GraalVM Community Edition here.The Graal compiler can bring performance advantages for highly-abstracted programs. For example, it includes a partial-escape-analysis optimization that can remove costly allocations of certain objects. This optimization determines when a new object is accessible outside a compilation unit and only allocates it on paths that “escape” the compilation unit (e.g. the object is passed as a parameter, stored in a field, or returned from a method). This can greatly improve performance of an application by reducing the number of heap allocations. Code using more modern Java features like Streams or Lambdas will see greater speedups as this type of code involves a significant number of such non- or partially-escaping objects. Code that is bound by things like I/O or memory allocations that cannot be removed by the compiler will see less improvement. For more information on performance tuning, refer to Compiler Configuration on JVM.Graph CompilationTo run guest programming languages, namely JavaScript, Ruby, R, Python, and WebAssembly in the same runtime as the host JVM-based language, the compiler should work with a language-independent intermediate representation (IR) between the source language and the machine code to be generated.A graph was selected for this role.The graph can represent similar statements of different languages in the same way, like “if” statements or loops, which makes it possible to mix languages in the same program.The Graal compiler can then perform language-independent optimization and generate machine code on this graph.GraalVM also includes the Truffle language implementation framework – a library, written in Java – to build interpreters for programming languages, which then run on GraalVM.These languages can consequently benefit from the optimization possibilities of the Graal compiler.The pipeline for such compilation is:  The Truffle framework code and data (Abstract Syntax Trees) is partially evaluated to produce a compilation graph. When such an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is hot (i.e., called many times), it is scheduled for compilation by the compiler.  The compilation graph is optimized by the Graal compiler to produce machine code.  JVMCI installs this machine code in the VM’s code cache.  The AST will automatically redirect execution to the installed machine code once it is available.Ahead-of-time CompilationBesides the Truffle framework, GraalVM incorporates its optimizing compiler into an advanced ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation technology – Native Image – which translates Java and JVM-based code into a native platform executable.These native executables start nearly instantaneously, are smaller, and consume less resources of the same Java application, making them ideal for cloud deployments and microservices.For more information about the AOT compilation, go to Native Image.Compiler Operating ModesThere are two operating modes of the Graal compiler when used as the HotSpot JIT compiler: as pre-compiled machine code (“libgraal”), or as dynamically executed Java bytecode (“jargraal”).libgraal: the Graal compiler is compiled ahead-of-time into a native shared library.In this operating mode, the shared library is loaded by the HotSpot VM.The compiler uses memory separate from the HotSpot heap.It runs fast from the start since it does not need to warm up.This is the default and recommended mode of operation.jargraal: the Graal compiler goes through the same warm-up phase that the rest of the Java application does.That is, it is first interpreted before its hot methods are compiled.This mode is selected with the -XX:-UseJVMCINativeLibrary command line option.Diagnostic DataIf an uncaught exception is thrown by the compiler, the compilation is simply discarded and execution continues.The Graal compiler can instead produce diagnostic data (such as immediate representation graphs) that can be submitted along with a bug report.This is enabled with -Djdk.graal.CompilationFailureAction=Diagnose.The default location of the diagnostics output is in graal_dumps/ under the current working directory of the process but can be changed with the -Djdk.graal.DumpPath option.During the VM shutdown, the location of the archive containing the diagnostic data is printed to the console.Furthermore, diagnostic data can be produced for any compilation performed by the Graal compiler with the -Djdk.graal.Dump option.This will produce diagnostic data for every method compiled by the compiler.To refine the set of methods for which diagnostic data is produced, use the -Djdk.graal.MethodFilter=&amp;lt;class&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;method&amp;gt; option.For example, -Djdk.graal.MethodFilter=java.lang.String.*,HashMap.get will produce diagnostic data only for methods in the java.lang.String class as well as methods named get in a class whose non-qualified name is HashMap.Instead of being written to a file, diagnostic data can also be sent over the network to the Ideal Graph Visualizer.This requires the -Djdk.graal.PrintGraph=Network option, upon which the compiler will try to send diagnostic data to 127.0.0.1:4445.This network endpoint can be configured with the -Djdk.graal.PrintGraphHost and -Djdk.graal.PrintGraphPort options.Related Documentation  JVM Operations Manual  Compiler Configuration on JVM",

For self-contained executables, generated with GraalVM Native Image, containers are an obvious deployment choice.To support container-based development, there are several GraalVM container images available, depending on the platform, the architecture, the Java version, and the edition:  Oracle GraalVM container images, available in Oracle Container Registry (OCR) under the GraalVM Free Terms and Conditions (GFTC) license.  GraalVM Community Edition container images published in the GitHub Container Registry.This guide shows how to containerise a native executable for your Java application.You will use a GraalVM container image with Native Image to compile a Java application ahead-of-time into a native executable.Download a Sample ApplicationThis guide uses the Spring Boot 3 Native Image Microservice example. The example is a minimal REST-based API application, built on top of Spring Boot 3.If you call the HTTP endpoint /jibber, it will return some nonsense verse generated in the style of the Jabberwocky poem, by Lewis Carroll.PrerequisiteMake sure you have installed a GraalVM JDK.The easiest way to get started is with SDKMAN!.For other installation options, visit the Downloads section.      Install and run a Docker-API compatible container runtime such as Rancher Desktop, Docker, or Podman.    Clone the GraalVM Demos repository:     git clone https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-demos    Change directory to spring-native-image/:     cd spring-native-image  Build and Run as a Native ExecutableWith the built-in support for GraalVM Native Image in Spring Boot 3, it has become much easier to compile a Spring Boot 3 application into a native executable.  Build a native executable:     ./mvnw native:compile -Pnative    The -Pnative profile is used to generate a native executable for your platform. This will generate a native executable called benchmark-jibber in the target/ directory.    Run the native executable and put it into the background by appending &amp;amp;:     ./target/benchmark-jibber &amp;amp;    Call the endpoint using curl:     curl http://localhost:8080/jibber    You should get a random nonsense verse.    Bring the application to the foreground using fg, and then enter &amp;lt;CTRL-c&amp;gt; to terminate the application.Containerise the Native ExecutableThe generated native executable is platform-dependent.      Containerise the native executable using the following command:          On Linux, containerize the native executable generated in the previous step using the following command:          docker build -f Dockerfiles/Dockerfile.native --build-arg APP_FILE=benchmark-jibber -t jibber-benchmark:native.0.0.1-SNAPSHOT .            On MacOS, Windows, or Linux, use multistage Docker builds to build a native executable inside a container, and package the native executable in a lightweight container image:          docker build -f Dockerfiles/Dockerfile -t jibber-benchmark:native.0.0.1-SNAPSHOT .              Run the application:     docker run --rm --name native -p 8080:8080 jibber-benchmark:native.0.0.1-SNAPSHOT    From a new terminal window, call the endpoint using curl:     curl http://localhost:8080/jibber    It should generate a random nonsense verse.    To stop the application, first get the container id using docker ps, and then run:     docker rm -f &amp;lt;container_id&amp;gt;    To delete the container images, first get the image id using docker images, and then run:     docker rmi -f &amp;lt;image_1_id&amp;gt; &amp;lt;image_n_id&amp;gt;  SummaryIn this guide, you saw how to use GraalVM container images to containerize a native executable for your Java application.With GraalVM Native Image you can build a statically linked native executable by packaging the native executable directly into tiny containers such as scratch or distroless images.Related Documentation  Build a Static or Mostly-Static Native Executable  Oracle GraalVM Container Images  Hands-on Lab: GraalVM Native Image, Spring and Containerisation",

Note, that a security vulnerability should be reported to secalert_us@oracle.com.  By creating GitHub pull requests.If you consider contributing solely to the documentation, please check this guide.If you consider contributing to the GraalVM core, start by learning how to build a GraalVM distribution from sources, using mx – a unique building tool.Learn how to set up a proper development enviroment, load the GraalVM project into the IDE, and see the main classes one could look at to have the basic understanding what the compiler is doing. This video demonstartes the above.                              watch video                                                How to Become a GraalVM Contributor?Further below are some tips for contributing to GraalVM Community Edition and its projects, hosted in the Oracle organization on GitHub.We expect a contributor to abide by the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct.Overall, there are three stages:I. Create a Pull RequestIf you believe your contribution is valuable for others, create a pull request (PR).The common process is forking a repository, submitting a change and creating a PR.When creating a PR, please make sure to include a clear description of the intention of the change, unless the change is self-explanatory, e.g., a version update.Describe why (1) the change or feature is needed, (2) how it is implemented, and, optionally, (3) what further implications it may have.You can either use the PR request description field or the commit message.It is recommended to address one feature or change per PR request.Once you have created a pull request, the Travis CI service will run some sanity checks on your change.Be sure to address any obvious issues caught by these checks (e.g., formatting violation), but keep in mind that test failures may not be directly related to your changes (no gate is perfect due to infrastructure issues and transient test failures).II. Sign the Oracle Contributor AgreementTo allow your pull request to be accepted, you will need to sign the Oracle Contributor Agreement (OCA).There are two types of OCAs: Individual OCAs and Company OCAs. Sign it online and, once your name or organization shows up in the OCA signatory list, we will add you to the database used to check that pull request authors are covered under the OCA.If it appears to be a delay in your entry showing up in the signatories list, please send an email to oracle-ca_us@oracle.com.If your entry is in the signatories list, but the bot leaves a message on your pull request that you have not signed the OCA, leave a comment on the pull request stating that you are now covered by the OCA.The bot operates from a database separate from the OCA signatories list (since the latter does not necessarily include email details) and must be manually updated.III. Review and MergeAn Oracle employee reviews the proposed change and once the pull request is in a mergeable state, takes responsibility for merging it to the main branch.To ensure extra diligence in terms of verifying externally contributed code meeting these requirements, we have an inbound-check-bot.What to Expect When Submitting a Pull Request?There are many directions to explore from smaller changes like bug fixes or improvements to the API documentation to larger changes that can either speed up theexecution, or give better control over the system.We look forward to extend the GraalVM ecosystem by implementing new languages support with the Truffle framework, providing better tooling for polyglot programming, or proposing new embedding scenarios.The continuous efforts are directed to the machine learning for optimizing compiler configurations.Contributors are welcomed to join the development of a fully meta-circular Java runtime written in Java.We keep on investigating techniques for more efficient memory usage and pursue improving performance for different workloads.To reach GraalVM developers for questions related to working with GraalVM sources, subscribe and post to graalvm-dev@oss.oracle.com.",

          "content": "Create a Heap Dump from a Native ExecutableYou can create a heap dump of a running executable to monitor its execution.Just like any other Java heap dump, it can be opened with the VisualVM tool.To enable heap dump support, a native executable must be built with the --enable-monitoring=heapdump option. A heap dump can then be created in the following ways:  Create a heap dump with VisualVM.  The command-line option -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError can be used to create a heap dump when the native executable runs out of Java heap memory.  Dump the initial heap of a native executable using the -XX:+DumpHeapAndExit command-line option.  Create a heap dump by sending a SIGUSR1 signal to the application at runtime.  Create a heap dump programmatically using the org.graalvm.nativeimage.VMRuntime#dumpHeap API.All approaches are described below.  Note: By default, a heap dump is created in the current working directory. The -XX:HeapDumpPath option can be used to specify an alternative filename or directory. For example:./helloworld -XX:HeapDumpPath=$HOME/helloworld.hprof  Also note: It is not possible to create a heap dump on the Microsoft Windows platform.Create a Heap Dump with VisualVMA convenient way to create a heap dump is to use VisualVM.For this, you need to add jvmstat to the --enable-monitoring option (for example, --enable-monitoring=heapdump,jvmstat).This will allow VisualVM to pick up and list running Native Image processes.You can then request a heap dump in the same way you can request one when your application runs on the JVM (for example, right-click on the process, then select Heap Dump).Create a Heap Dump on OutOfMemoryErrorStart the application with the option -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError to get a heap dump when the native executable throws an OutOfMemoryError because it ran out of Java heap memory.The heap dump is created in a file named svm-heapdump-&amp;lt;PID&amp;gt;-OOME.hprof.For example:./mem-leak-example -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryErrorDumping heap to svm-heapdump-67799-OOME.hprof ...Heap dump file created [10046752 bytes in 0.49 secs]Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Garbage-collected heap size exceeded.Dump the Initial Heap of a Native ExecutableUse the -XX:+DumpHeapAndExit command-line option to dump the initial heap of a native executable.This can be useful to identify which objects the Native Image build process allocated to the executable’s heap. For a HelloWorld example, use the option as follows:$JAVA_HOME/bin/native-image HelloWorld --enable-monitoring=heapdump./helloworld -XX:+DumpHeapAndExitHeap dump created at &#39;/path/to/helloworld.hprof&#39;.Create a Heap Dump with SIGUSR1 (Linux/macOS only)  Note: This requires the Signal API, which is enabled by default except when building shared libraries.The following example is a simple multi-threaded Java application that runs for 60 seconds. This provides you with enough time to send it a SIGUSR1 signal. The application will handle the signal and create a heap dump in the application’s working directory. The heap dump will contain the Collection of Persons referenced by the static variable CROWD.Follow these steps to build a native executable that will produce a heap dump when it receives a SIGUSR1 signal.PrerequisiteMake sure you have installed a GraalVM JDK.The easiest way to get started is with SDKMAN!.For other installation options, visit the Downloads section.

(This causes the resulting native executable to produce a heap dump when it receives a SIGUSR1 signal.)     native-image SVMHeapDump --enable-monitoring=heapdump    (The native-image builder creates a native executable from the file SVMHeapDump.class. When the command completes, the native executable svmheapdump is created in the current directory.)        Run the application, send it a signal, and check the heap dump:    Run the application:     ./svmheapdump 17 May 2022, 16:38:13: Hello GraalVM native image developer!  The PID of this process is: 57509 Send it a signal: &#39;kill -SIGUSR1 57509&#39;  to dump the heap into the working directory. Starting thread! 17 May 2022, 16:38:13: Thread started, it will run for 60 seconds    Make a note of the PID and open a second terminal.  Use the PID to send a signal to the application.  For example, if the PID is 57509:     kill -SIGUSR1 57509    The heap dump will be created in the working directory while the application continues to run. The heap dump can be opened with the VisualVM tool, as illustrated below.      Create a Heap Dump from within a Native ExecutableThe following example shows how to create a heap dump from a running native executable using VMRuntime.dumpHeap() if some condition is met.The condition to create a heap dump is provided as an option on the command line.      Save the code below in a file named SVMHeapDumpAPI.java.     import java.io.File; import java.io.FileOutputStream; import java.io.IOException; import java.nio.charset.Charset; import java.text.DateFormat; import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.Collection; import java.util.Date; import java.util.Random; import org.graalvm.nativeimage.VMRuntime; public class SVMHeapDumpAPI {     static Collection&amp;lt;Person&amp;gt; CROWD = new ArrayList&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();     /**     * @param args the command line arguments     */     public static void main(String[] args) {            // Populate the crowd         for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 1000; i++) {             CROWD.add(new Person());         }         StringBuffer sb1 = new StringBuffer(100);         sb1.append(DateFormat.getDateTimeInstance().format(new Date()));         sb1.append(&quot;: Hello GraalVM native image developer. nYour command line options are: &quot;);         if (args.length &amp;gt; 0) {             sb1.append(args[0]);             System.out.println(sb1);             if (args[0].equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;--heapdump&quot;)) {                 createHeapDump();             }         } else {             sb1.append(&quot;None&quot;);             System.out.println(sb1);         }     }     /**     * Create a heap dump and save it into temp file     */     private static void createHeapDump() {         try {             File file = File.createTempFile(&quot;SVMHeapDumpAPI-&quot;, &quot;.hprof&quot;);             VMRuntime.dumpHeap(file.getAbsolutePath(), false);             System.out.println(&quot;  Heap dump created &quot; + file.getAbsolutePath() + &quot;, size: &quot; + file.length());         } catch (UnsupportedOperationException unsupported) {             System.err.println(&quot;Heap dump creation failed: &quot; + unsupported.getMessage());         } catch (IOException ioe) {             System.err.println(&quot;IO went wrong: &quot; + ioe.getMessage());         }     } } class Person {         private static Random R = new Random();         private String name;         private int age;                     public Person() {             byte[] array = new byte[7];             R.nextBytes(array);             name = new String(array, Charset.forName(&quot;UTF-8&quot;));             age = R.nextInt(100);         }     }    As in the earlier example, the application creates a Collection of Persons referenced by the static variable CROWD.  It then checks the command line to see if heap dump has to be created, and then in method createHeapDump() creates the heap dump.        Build a native executable.    Compile SVMHeapDumpAPI.java and build a native executable:     javac SVMHeapDumpAPI.java     native-image SVMHeapDumpAPI    When the command completes, the svmheapdumpapi native executable is created in the current directory.        Run the application and check the heap dump    Now you can run your native executable and create a heap dump from it with output similar to the following:     ./svmheapdumpapi --heapdump Sep 15, 2020, 4:06:36 PM: Hello GraalVM native image developer. Your command line options are: --heapdump   Heap dump created /var/folders/hw/s9d78jts67gdc8cfyq5fjcdm0000gp/T/SVMHeapDump-6437252222863577987.hprof, size: 8051959    The resulting heap dump can be then opened with the VisualVM tool like any other Java heap dump, as illustrated below.

          "title": "Debug Adapter Protocol",
          "content": "Debug Adapter ProtocolGraalVM supports debugging of guest language applications, written in any of the supported languages, i.e., JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, R, Ruby, and provides a built-in implementation of the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP).By definition, Debug Adapter Protocol is to standardize the “communication” between the debugging component and a concrete debugger or runtime.This allows you to attach compatible debuggers such as Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to GraalVM.To open a debugger port serving Debug Adapter Protocol, you need to pass the --dap option to the command line launcher.The usage of Debug Adapter Protocol is similar to the existing Chrome DevTools Protocol implementation in the GraalVM runtime:  --dap.Suspend=false: disable the execution suspension at first source line, enabled by default.  --dap.WaitAttached: do not execute any source code until debugger client is attached. The default is false.  --dap=&amp;lt;[[host:]port]&amp;gt;: start the debugger on a different port than default (&amp;lt;host&amp;gt;:4711).Then you need a DAP client to connect to the open DAP port. VS Code will be used as an example.1. Save this Node.js application in a file named App.js:const express = require(&#39;express&#39;)const app = express()const port = 3000app.get(&#39;/&#39;, (req, res) =&amp;gt; {  res.send(&#39;Hello World!&#39;)})app.get(&#39;/neverCalled&#39;, (req, res) =&amp;gt; {  res.send(&#39;You should not be here&#39;)})app.get(&#39;/shutdown&#39;, (req, res) =&amp;gt; {  process.exit();})app.listen(port, () =&amp;gt; console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}!`))2. Install the express module dependency in the directory where you saved the file:$JAVA_HOME/bin/npm install express3. Run the application with DAP enabled:$JAVA_HOME/bin/node --dap App.js[Graal DAP] Starting server and listening on localhost/127.0.0.1:47114. Start VS Code, freshly installed without any extensions:code .5. Open the App.js source in VS Code, and put a breakpoint, for example, at line 6 (res.send(&#39;Hello World!&#39;)).6. Navigate to View &amp;gt; Run to create a launch configuration (Ctrl+Shift+D):7. Then create the launch.json file with the following content:{    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.2.0&quot;,    &quot;configurations&quot;: [        {            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Attach&quot;,            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;node&quot;,            &quot;request&quot;: &quot;attach&quot;,            &quot;debugServer&quot;: 4711        }    ]}8. Start debugging (F5).The other approach is to use VS Code with the GraalVM extension installed.Follow the steps described in Node.js and JavaScript Debugging, and launch the application being debugged directly from VS Code.When debugging a guest language application from VS Code, a user can choose a protocol to use by setting the protocol attribute in the corresponding debug configuration to either chromeDevTools or debugAdapter.To connect to the open DAP port in this scenario, the content of the launch.json should be:{    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.2.0&quot;,    &quot;configurations&quot;: [        {            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;graalvm&quot;,            &quot;request&quot;: &quot;launch&quot;,            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Launch Node App&quot;,            &quot;outputCapture&quot;: &quot;std&quot;,            &quot;protocol&quot;: &quot;debugAdapter&quot;,            &quot;program&quot;: &quot;${workspaceFolder}/App.js&quot;        }    ]}The advantage of using Debug Adapter Protocol over Chrome Dev Tools is that (1) it is ‘native’ to Visual Studio Code (VS Code), meaning it does not require any intermediate translatation, and (2) that it supports multithreading, which can be particually useful to debug, e.g., a Ruby application.",

Note that later versions might have slightly different formatting of debugger output (which, for example, may cause CI/CD gate checks to fail)  GDB bundled in recent Linux releases works just fine for debugging sessionsBuild a Native Executable with Debug InformationTo build a native executable with debug information, provide the -g command-line option for javac when compiling the application, and then to the native-image builder. This enables source-level debugging, and the debugger (GDB) then correlates machine instructions with specific source lines in Java files.Adding -g to the native-image arguments causes debuginfo to be generated. Next to the native executable, there will be an &amp;lt;executable_name&amp;gt;.debug file that contains debuginfo and a sources/ directory that contains Java source files, which the debugger uses to show sources for lineinfo. For example:hello_imagehello_image.debugsourcesGDB automatically loads the &amp;lt;executable_name&amp;gt;.debug file for a given native executable &amp;lt;executable_name&amp;gt;. (There is a link between the native executable and its *.debug  file)  For a better debugging experience, we recommend combining -g with -O0.The latter option disables inlining and other optimizations of the Graal compiler, which otherwise would be observable in the debugger (for example, the debugger may jump back and forth between lines instead of allowing you to step from one line to the next one).At the same time, -O0 also enables additional metadata to be collected in the compiler, which then helps the debugger to resolve, for example, local variables.Use GDB with New Debug InformationBuild InformationThe *.debug file contains additional information about the build, which can be accessed as follows:readelf -p .debug.svm.imagebuild.classpath hello_image.debugIt gives a list of all classpath entries that were used to build the native executable:String dump of section &#39;.debug.svm.imagebuild.classpath&#39;:  [     0]  /home/user/.mx/cache/HAMCREST_e237ae735aac4fa5a7253ec693191f42ef7ddce384c11d29fbf605981c0be077d086757409acad53cb5b9e53d86a07cc428d459ff0f5b00d32a8cbbca390be49/hamcrest.jar  [    b0]  /home/user/.mx/cache/JUNIT_5974670c3d178a12da5929ba5dd9b4f5ff461bdc1b92618c2c36d53e88650df7adbf3c1684017bb082b477cb8f40f15dcf7526f06f06183f93118ba9ebeaccce/junit.jar  [   15a]  /home/user/mx/mxbuild/jdk20/dists/jdk9/junit-tool.jar  [   1a9]  /home/user/graal/substratevm/mxbuild/jdk20/com.oracle.svm.test/binThe following sections are available  .debug.svm.imagebuild.classpath  .debug.svm.imagebuild.modulepath  .debug.svm.imagebuild.arguments  .debug.svm.imagebuild.java.propertiesWhere is the main() Method?Useinfo functions ::mainto find all methods named main and then use b &amp;lt;main method name&amp;gt;, for example:(gdb) info functions ::mainAll functions matching regular expression &quot;::main&quot;:File hello/Hello.java:76:void hello.Hello::main(java.lang.String[]*);File java/util/Timer.java:534:void java.util.TimerThread::mainLoop();(gdb) b &#39;hello.Hello::main&#39;Breakpoint 1 at 0x83c030: file hello/Hello.java, line 76.Set a BreakpointFirst, find the type of the method you want to set a breakpoint in, for example:(gdb) info types ArrayListAll types matching regular expression &quot;ArrayList&quot;:...File java/util/ArrayList.java:java.util.ArrayList;java.util.ArrayList$ArrayListSpliterator;java.util.ArrayList$Itr;java.util.ArrayList$ListItr;...Now use the following GDB autocompletion:(gdb) b &#39;java.util.ArrayList::Pressing tab twice now shows all ArrayList methods to choose from:java.util.ArrayList::ArrayList(int)                                                java.util.ArrayList::iterator()java.util.ArrayList::ArrayList(java.util.Collection*)                              java.util.ArrayList::lastIndexOf(java.lang.Object*)java.util.ArrayList::add(int, java.lang.Object*)                                   java.util.ArrayList::lastIndexOfRange(java.lang.Object*, int, int)java.util.ArrayList::add(java.lang.Object*)                                        java.util.ArrayList::listIterator()java.util.ArrayList::add(java.lang.Object*, java.lang.Object[]*, int)              java.util.ArrayList::listIterator(int)java.util.ArrayList::addAll(int, java.util.Collection*)                            java.util.ArrayList::nBits(int)java.util.ArrayList::addAll(java.util.Collection*)                                 java.util.ArrayList::outOfBoundsMsg(int)...If we complete with(gdb) b &#39;java.util.ArrayList::add`breakpoints in all variants of add are installed.ArraysArrays have a data field that can be accessed via an index to get the individual array elements, for example:Thread 1 &quot;hello_image&quot; hit Breakpoint 1, hello.Hello::main(java.lang.String[]*) (args=0x7ff33f800898) at hello/Hello.java:7676        Greeter greeter = Greeter.greeter(args);(gdb) p args$1 = (java.lang.String[] *) 0x7ff33f800898(gdb) p *args$2 = {  &amp;lt;java.lang.Object&amp;gt; = {    &amp;lt;_objhdr&amp;gt; = {      hub = 0x1e37be0    }, &amp;lt;No data fields&amp;gt;},   members of java.lang.String[]:  len = 4,  data = 0x7ff33f8008a0}(gdb) p args.data$3 = 0x7ff33f8008a0(gdb) ptype args.datatype = class _z_.java.lang.String : public java.lang.String {} *[0]Here args.data can be accessed via an index.In this case, the first of the four array elements is a pointer to a String:(gdb) p args.data[0]$4 = (_z_.java.lang.String *) 0x27011aStringsTo see the actual contents of a Java String object, look at its value field, for example:(gdb) p args.data[0]$4 = (_z_.java.lang.String *) 0x27011aargs.data[0] points to a String object.

We have to pass a value for graal_isolatethread_t and the absolute address of the hub we want to get printed.In most situations, the value for graal_isolatethread_t is just the value of the current IsolateThread that can be found in a platform-specific register:            Platform      Register                  amd64      $r15              aarch64      $r28      Finally, before we can call svm_dbg_print_hub we also have to make sure we have the absolute address of the hub we want to print.

Create a file .vscode/launch.json with this contents:{    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.2.0&quot;,    &quot;configurations&quot;: [        {            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Attach&quot;,            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;node&quot;,            &quot;request&quot;: &quot;attach&quot;,            &quot;debugServer&quot;: 4711        }    ]}  Run TruffleRuby on the command line and pass --dap, e.g.     $ ruby --dap test.rb $ ruby --dap -Ilib test/some_test.rb $ TRUFFLERUBYOPT=--dap bundle exec rspec some_spec.rb    In VSCode click on Run -&amp;gt; Start Debugging.With the GraalVM VSCode extensionFirst install the GraalVM VSCode extension.Then follow this documentation to debug TruffleRuby with VSCode.RubyMineUnfortunately RubyMine / IntelliJ IDEA do not support the Debug Adapter Protocol yet for Ruby debugging.Please vote or comment on the feature request to share your interest.Command-line Debugging OptionsPrinting ExceptionsThere are two ways to print exceptions, which can be useful to find the source of an error:  the standard Ruby -d flag which prints the file:line where each exception was raised  --backtraces-raise which show the full backtrace on each exception raisedBoth print all exceptions even if the exceptions are later rescued.Java exceptions can be printed with --exceptions-print-uncaught-java or--exceptions-print-java.See other --backtraces-* and --exceptions-* options for more possibilities.Printing Stacktraces and Backtraces of a Running ProcessOne can send the SIGQUIT signal to TruffleRuby to make it print the Java stacktraces of all threads.Ctrl +   can be used to send SIGQUIT to the current process in a terminal.This is useful to debug hangs and deadlocks, or to know what the process is doing.This works on both TruffleRuby Native and JVM.Sending SIGALRM to a TruffleRuby process will print the Ruby backtraces of all threads.More Information in BacktracesTruffleRuby tries to match MRI’s backtrace format as closely as possible.This sometimes means that extra available information is not displayed.When debugging you may want to see this information.An option to show more information is --backtraces-interleave-java=true, which shows you the Java methods involved in executing each Ruby method.When you are interoperating with other languages, including C extensions, backtraces for Java exceptions may be missing information, as the Java frames are gone by the time Ruby has a chance to format them into a backtrace.Printing SubprocessesYou can log subprocesses created by TruffleRuby using the option --log-subprocess.$ ruby --log-subprocess -e &#39;`ls .`&#39;[ruby] INFO: spawn: ls .This is not transitive though, unless you set this option in TRUFFLERUBYOPT.Printing TruffleRuby Processes and ArgumentsYou can log TruffleRuby processes created using the bin/truffleruby launcher and their arguments with --log-process-args.$ ruby --log-process-args -e 0[ruby] INFO: new process: truffleruby --log-process-args -e 0You can set this option in TRUFFLERUBYOPT to make it apply to TruffleRuby subprocess as well.Separate log files will be used for different subprocesses running at the same time when using --log.file=PATH.These log files start with the same path but end with 1, 2, etc suffixes.",

          "content": "Deploying TruffleRubyIf you are attempting to experiment with deploying TruffleRuby to production we would encourage you to contact us so we can help you understand what is possible at the moment and to help solve any issues for you.This document details TruffleRuby’s different runtime configurations.TruffleRuby Runtime ConfigurationsThere are two main configurations of TruffleRuby - Native and JVM.It is important to understand the different configurations of TruffleRuby, as each has different capabilities and performance characteristics.You should pick the execution mode that is appropriate for your application.Native ConfigurationIn the Native Standalone, TruffleRuby runs in the native configuration.In this configuration, TruffleRuby is ahead-of-time compiled to a standalone native executable.This means that you do not need a JVM installed on your system to use it.The advantages of the native configuration are that it starts about as fast as MRI, it may use less memory, and it becomes fast in less time than the JVM configuration.The disadvantages are that you can’t use Java tools like VisualVM, it is less convenient for Java interoperability (see the details here), and peak performance may be lower than on the JVM.The native configuration is used by default, but you can also request it using --native.To use polyglot programming with the native configuration, you need to pass the --polyglot flag.JVM ConfigurationTruffleRuby can also be used in the JVM configuration (by using the JVM Standalone or through embedding), where it runs as a normal Java application on the JVM.The advantages of the JVM configuration are that you can use Java interoperability easily, and peak performance may be higher than the native configuration.The disadvantages are that it takes much longer to start and to get fast, and may use more memory.You can select the JVM configuration by passing --jvm.Selecting the Best ConfigurationIf you are running a short-running program you probably want the default, native, configuration.If you are running a long-running program and want the highest possible performance you probably want the JVM configuration, by using --jvm.Getting the Best Startup Time PerformanceTo get the best startup time in most cases you want to use the native configuration, which is the default.Getting the Lowest Memory FootprintTo get the lowest memory footprint you probably initially want to use the native configuration, but as you get a larger working set of objects you may find that the simpler garbage collector and current lack of compressed ordinary object pointers (OOPS) actually increases your memory footprint and you will be better off with the JVM configuration using --jvm to reduce memory use.Getting the Best Peak Performance from TruffleRubyTo get the best peak performance from TruffleRuby for longer-running applications we would in most cases recommend the JVM configuration with --jvm.However to reach this peak performance you need to warm-up TruffleRuby, as you do with most heavily optimising virtual machines.This is done by running the application under load for a period of time.If you monitor the performance (by measuring operation time or response time) you will see it reduce over time and then probably stabilise.LoggingRuby application logging and warning works as in the standard implementation of Ruby.For logging of TruffleRuby internals, standard Java logging is used.The logging level can be set with --log.level=INFO, =FINEST, or so on.",

Note: The usage description for polyglot embeddings was revised with the GraalVM for JDK 22 (24.0.0) release. If you are still using a GraalVM version older than 23.1.x, ensure the correct version of the documentation is displayed. More information on the change can be found in the release notes.Dependency SetupSince GraalVM Polyglot API version 23.1.0, all necessary artifacts can be downloaded directly from Maven Central.All artifacts relevant to embedders can be found in the Maven dependency group org.graalvm.polyglot.See the polyglot embedding demonstration on GitHub for a complete runnable example.Here is an example Maven dependency setup that you can put into your project:&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt; &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.polyglot&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;polyglot&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;24.0.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt; &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.polyglot&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;!-- Select language: js, ruby, python, java, llvm, wasm, languages--&amp;gt;&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;js&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;24.0.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt; &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;pom&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!-- add additional languages if needed --&amp;gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt; &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.polyglot&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;!-- Select tools: profiler, inspect, coverage, dap, tools --&amp;gt;&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;tools&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;24.0.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt; &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;pom&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!-- add specific tools if needed --&amp;gt;Language and tool dependencies use the GraalVM Free Terms and Conditions (GFTC) license.To use community-licensed versions instead, add the -community suffix to each artifact (e.g., js-community).To access polyglot isolate artifacts, use the -isolate suffix instead (e.g. js-isolate).The artifacts languages and tools include all available languages and tools as dependencies. This artifact might grow or shrink between major releases. We recommend selecting only the needed language(s) for a production deployment.  The pom type is a requirement for language or tool dependencies.Additionally, your module-info.java file should require org.graalvm.polyglot when using Java modules.module com.mycompany.app {  requires org.graalvm.polyglot;}Whether your configuration can run with a Truffle runtime optimization depends on the GraalVM JDK you use.For further details, refer to the Runtime Compilation section.We recommend configuring polyglot embeddings using modules and the module-path whenever possible. Be aware that using polyglot from the class-path instead will enable access to unsafe APIs for all libraries on the class-path.If the application is not yet modularized, hybrid use of the class and module-path is possible.For example:$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -classpath=lib --module-path=lib/polyglot --add-modules=org.graalvm.polyglot ...In this example, lib/polyglot folder should contain all polyglot and language jars.In order to access polyglot classes from the class-path you also need to specify the --add-modules=org.graalvm.polyglot JVM option.If you are using native-image polyglot modules on the class-path will be automatically upgraded to the module-path.While we do support creating single uber Jars from polyglot libraries, e.g. using the Maven Assembly plugin, we do not recommend it.Also note that uber jars are not supported in combination with creating native-images.Compile and Run a Polyglot ApplicationGraalVM can run polyglot applications written in any language implemented with the Truffle language implementation framework.These languages are henceforth referenced as guest languages.Complete the steps in this section to create a sample polyglot application that runs on GraalVM and demonstrates programming language interoperability.      Create a new Java project using Maven.    Clone the polyglot-embedding-demo repository:     git clone https://github.com/graalvm/polyglot-embedding-demo.git        Insert the example code into the Main class.        Update the Maven pom.xml dependency configuration to include the languages to run as described in the previous section.        Download and setup GraalVM by setting the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to a GraalVM JDK.    Run mvn package exec:exec to build and execute the sample code.You now have a polyglot application that consists of a Java host application and guest language code, running on GraalVM.You can use this application with other code examples to demonstrate more advanced capabilities of the Polyglot API.Define Guest Language Functions as Java ValuesPolyglot applications let you take values from one programming language and use them with other languages.Use the code example in this section with your polyglot application to show how the Polyglot API can return JavaScript, R, Ruby, or Python functions as Java values.              // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;public class function_js {    public static void main(String[] args) {// BEGIN-SNIPPETtry (Context context = Context.create()) {    Value function = context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;x =&amp;gt; x+1&quot;);    assert function.canExecute();    int x = function.execute(41).asInt();    assert x == 42;}// END-SNIPPET    }}                        // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;public class function_R {    public static void main(String[] args) {// BEGIN-SNIPPETtry (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                           .allowAllAccess(true)                       .build()) {    Value function = context.eval(&quot;R&quot;, &quot;function(x) x + 1&quot;);    assert function.canExecute();    int x = function.execute(41).asInt();    assert x == 42;}// END-SNIPPET    }}                        // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;public class function_ruby {    public static void main(String[] args) {// BEGIN-SNIPPETtry (Context context = Context.create()) {    Value function = context.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;proc { |x| x + 1 }&quot;);    assert function.canExecute();    int x = function.execute(41).asInt();    assert x == 42;} // END-SNIPPET    }}                        // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;public class function_python {    public static void main(String[] args) {// BEGIN-SNIPPETtry (Context context = Context.create()) {    Value function = context.eval(&quot;python&quot;, &quot;lambda x: x + 1&quot;);    assert function.canExecute();    int x = function.execute(41).asInt();    assert x == 42;} // END-SNIPPET    }}                JavaScript      R      Ruby      Python       In this code:  Value function is a Java value that refers to a function.  The eval call parses the script and returns the guest language function.  The first assertion checks that the value returned by the code snippet can be executed.  The execute call executes the function with the argument 41.  The asInt call converts the result to a Java int.  The second assertion verifies that the result was incremented by one as expected.Access Guest Languages Directly from JavaPolyglot applications can readily access most language types and are not limited to functions.Host languages, such as Java, can directly access guest language values embedded in the polyglot application.Use the code example in this section with your polyglot application to show how the Polyglot API can access objects, numbers, strings, and arrays.              // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;public class access_js_from_java {    public static void main(String[] args) {// BEGIN-SNIPPETtry (Context context = Context.create()) {    Value result = context.eval(&quot;js&quot;,                     &quot;({ &quot;                   +                        &quot;id   : 42, &quot;       +                        &quot;text : &#39;42&#39;, &quot;     +                        &quot;arr  : [1,42,3] &quot;  +                    &quot;})&quot;);    assert result.hasMembers();    int id = result.getMember(&quot;id&quot;).asInt();    assert id == 42;    String text = result.getMember(&quot;text&quot;).asString();    assert text.equals(&quot;42&quot;);    Value array = result.getMember(&quot;arr&quot;);    assert array.hasArrayElements();    assert array.getArraySize() == 3;    assert array.getArrayElement(1).asInt() == 42;}// END-SNIPPET    }}                        // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;public class access_R_from_java {    public static void main(String[] args) {// BEGIN-SNIPPETtry (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                           .allowAllAccess(true)                       .build()) {    Value result = context.eval(&quot;R&quot;,                     &quot;list(&quot;                +                        &quot;id   = 42, &quot;      +                        &quot;text = &#39;42&#39;, &quot;    +                        &quot;arr  = c(1,42,3)&quot; +                    &quot;)&quot;);    assert result.hasMembers();        int id = result.getMember(&quot;id&quot;).asInt();    assert id == 42;        String text = result.getMember(&quot;text&quot;).asString();    assert text.equals(&quot;42&quot;);        Value array = result.getMember(&quot;arr&quot;);    assert array.hasArrayElements();    assert array.getArraySize() == 3;    assert array.getArrayElement(1).asInt() == 42;}// END-SNIPPET    }}                        // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;public class access_ruby_from_java {    public static void main(String[] args) {// BEGIN-SNIPPETtry (Context context = Context.create()) {    Value result = context.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;,                     &quot;o = Struct.new(:id, :text, :arr).new(&quot; +                        &quot;42, &quot;       +                        &quot;&#39;42&#39;, &quot;     +                        &quot;[1,42,3] &quot;  +                    &quot;)&quot;);    assert result.hasMembers();        int id = result.getMember(&quot;id&quot;).asInt();    assert id == 42;        String text = result.getMember(&quot;text&quot;).asString();    assert text.equals(&quot;42&quot;);        Value array = result.getMember(&quot;arr&quot;);    assert array.hasArrayElements();    assert array.getArraySize() == 3;    assert array.getArrayElement(1).asInt() == 42;}// END-SNIPPET    }}                        // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;public class access_python_from_java {    public static void main(String[] args) {// BEGIN-SNIPPETtry (Context context = Context.create()) {    Value result = context.eval(&quot;python&quot;,                     &quot;type(&#39;obj&#39;, (object,), {&quot; +                        &quot;&#39;id&#39;  : 42, &quot;         +                        &quot;&#39;text&#39;: &#39;42&#39;, &quot;       +                        &quot;&#39;arr&#39; : [1,42,3]&quot;     +                    &quot;})()&quot;);    assert result.hasMembers();        int id = result.getMember(&quot;id&quot;).asInt();    assert id == 42;        String text = result.getMember(&quot;text&quot;).asString();    assert text.equals(&quot;42&quot;);        Value array = result.getMember(&quot;arr&quot;);    assert array.hasArrayElements();    assert array.getArraySize() == 3;    assert array.getArrayElement(1).asInt() == 42;}// END-SNIPPET    }}                JavaScript      R      Ruby      Python       In this code:  Value result is an Object that contains three members: a number named id,a string named text, and an array named arr.  The first assertion verifies that the return value can contain members, whichindicates that the value is an object-like structure.  The id variable is initialized by reading the member with the name id fromthe resulting object. The result is then converted to a Java intusing asInt().  The next assert verifies that result has a value of 42.  The text variable is initialized using the value of the member text,which is also converted to a Java String using asString().  The following assertion verifies the result value is equal to theJava String &quot;42&quot;.  Next the arr member that holds an array is read.  Arrays return true for hasArrayElements. R array instances can havemembers and array elements at the same time.  The next assertion verifies that the size of the array equals three. ThePolyglot API supports big arrays, so the array length is of type long.  Finally we verify that the array element at index 1 equals 42. Arrayindexing with polyglot values is always zero-based, even for languages such asR where indices start with one.Access Java from Guest LanguagesPolyglot applications offer bi-directional access between guest languages and host languages.As a result, you can pass Java objects to guest languages.Since the Polyglot API is secure by default, access is limited in the default configuration.To permit guest languages to access any public method or field of a Java object, you have to explicitly specify allowAllAccess(true) when the context is built.In this mode, the guest language code can access any resource that is accessible to host Java code.Use the code example in this section with your polyglot application to show how guest languages can access primitive Java values, objects, arrays, and functional interfaces.              // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import java.util.concurrent.Callable;import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;public class access_java_from_js {// BEGIN-SNIPPETpublic static class MyClass {    public int               id    = 42;

The fields are initialized with 42, &quot;42&quot;, new int[]{1, 42, 3}, andlambda () -&amp;gt; 42 that always returns an int value of 42.  The Java class MyClass is instantiated and exported with the name javaObjinto the polyglot scope, which allows the host and guest languages to exchangesymbols.  A guest language script is evaluated that imports the javaObj symbol andassigns it to the local variable which is also named javaObj. To avoidconflicts with variables, every value in the polyglot scope must be explicitlyimported and exported in the top-most scope of the language.  The next two lines verify the contents of the Java object by comparing itto the number 42 and the string &#39;42&#39;.  The third verification reads from the second array position and compares itto the number 42. Whether arrays are accessed using 0-based or 1-based indicesdepends on the guest language. Independently of the language, the Java arraystored in the arr field is always accessed using translated 0-based indices. Forexample, in the R language, arrays are 1-based so the second array element isaccessible using index 2. In the JavaScript and Ruby languages, the secondarray element is at index 1. In all language examples, the Java array is readfrom using the same index 1.  The last line invokes the Java lambda that is contained in the field ret42and compares the result to the number value 42.  After the guest language script executes, validation takes place to ensurethat the script returns a boolean value of true as a result.Lookup Java Types from Guest LanguagesIn addition to passing Java objects to the guest language, it is possible to allow the lookup of Java types in the guest language.Use the code example in this section with your polyglot application to show how guest languages lookup Java types and instantiate them.              // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.Context;public class lookup_java_from_js {public static void main(String[] args) {// BEGIN-SNIPPETtry (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                           .allowAllAccess(true)                       .build()) {    java.math.BigDecimal v = context.eval(&quot;js&quot;,            &quot;var BigDecimal = Java.type(&#39;java.math.BigDecimal&#39;);&quot; +            &quot;BigDecimal.valueOf(10).pow(20)&quot;)        .asHostObject();    assert v.toString().equals(&quot;100000000000000000000&quot;);}// END-SNIPPET}}                        // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.Context;public class lookup_java_from_R {public static void main(String[] args) {// BEGIN-SNIPPETtry (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                           .allowAllAccess(true)                       .build()) {    java.math.BigDecimal v = context.eval(&quot;R&quot;,            &quot;BigDecimal = java.type(&#39;java.math.BigDecimal&#39;);n&quot; +             &quot;BigDecimal$valueOf(10)$pow(20)&quot;)        .asHostObject();    assert v.toString().equals(&quot;100000000000000000000&quot;);}// END-SNIPPET}}                        // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.Context;public class lookup_java_from_ruby {public static void main(String[] args) {// BEGIN-SNIPPETtry (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                           .allowAllAccess(true)                       .build()) {    java.math.BigDecimal v = context.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;,            &quot;BigDecimal = Java.type(&#39;java.math.BigDecimal&#39;)n&quot; +             &quot;BigDecimal.valueOf(10).pow(20)&quot;)        .asHostObject();    assert v.toString().equals(&quot;100000000000000000000&quot;);}// END-SNIPPET}}                         // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.Context;public class lookup_java_from_python {public static void main(String[] args) {// BEGIN-SNIPPETtry (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                           .allowAllAccess(true)                       .build()) {    java.math.BigDecimal v = context.eval(&quot;python&quot;,            &quot;import javan&quot; +            &quot;BigDecimal = java.type(&#39;java.math.BigDecimal&#39;)n&quot; +             &quot;BigDecimal.valueOf(10).pow(20)&quot;)        .asHostObject();    assert v.toString().equals(&quot;100000000000000000000&quot;);}// END-SNIPPET}}                JavaScript      R      Ruby      Python       In this code:  A new context is created with all access enabled (allowAllAccess(true)).  A guest language script is evaluated.  The script looks up the Java type java.math.BigDecimal and stores it in a variable named BigDecimal.  The static method BigDecimal.valueOf(long) is invoked to create newBigDecimals with value 10. In addition to looking up static Java methods, itis also possible to directly instantiate the returned Java type., e.g., inJavaScript using the new keyword.  The new decimal is used to invoke the pow instance method with 20 which calculates  10^20.  The result of the script is converted to a host object by calling asHostObject(). The return value is automatically cast to the BigDecimal type.  The result decimal string is asserted to equal to &quot;100000000000000000000&quot;.Computed Arrays Using Polyglot ProxiesThe Polyglot API includes polyglot proxy interfaces that let you customize Java interoperability by mimicking guest language types, such as objects, arrays, native objects, or primitives.Use the code example in this section with your polyglot application to see how you can implement arrays that compute their values lazily.

ComputedArray array overrides the method get and computes the valueusing an arithmetic expression.  The array proxy does not support write access. For this reason, it throwsan UnsupportedOperationException in the implementation of set.  The implementation for getSize returns Long.MAX_VALUE for its length.  The main method creates a new polyglot execution context.  A new instance of the ComputedArray class is then exported using the name arr.  The guest language script imports the arr symbol, which returns theexported proxy.  The second element and the 1000000000th element is accessed, summed up, andthen returned. Note that array indices from 1-based languages such as R areconverted to 0-based indices for proxy arrays.  The result of the language script is returned as a long value and verified.For more information about the polyglot proxy interfaces, see the Polyglot API JavaDoc.Host AccessThe Polyglot API by default restricts access to certain critical functionality, such as file I/O.These restrictions can be lifted entirely by setting allowAllAccess to true.  Note: The access restrictions are currently only supported with JavaScript.Controlling Access to Host FunctionsIt might be desireable to limit the access of guest applications to the host.For example, if a Java method is exposed that calls System.exit then the guest application will be able to exit the host process.In order to avoid accidentally exposed methods, no host access is allowed by default and every public method or field needs to be annotated with @HostAccess.Export explicitly.              // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.Context;import org.graalvm.polyglot.HostAccess;import org.graalvm.polyglot.PolyglotException;public class explicit_access_java_from_js {static// BEGIN-SNIPPETpublic class Employee {    private final String name;    Employee(String name) {this.name = name;}    @HostAccess.Export    public String getName() {        return name;    }}//END-SNIPPETstatic//BEGIN-SNIPPETpublic class Services {    @HostAccess.Export    public Employee createEmployee(String name) {        return new Employee(name);    }        public void exitVM() {        System.exit(1);    }}public static void main(String[] args) {    try (Context context = Context.create()) {        Services services = new Services();        context.getBindings(&quot;js&quot;).putMember(&quot;services&quot;, services);        String name = context.eval(&quot;js&quot;,                &quot;let emp = services.createEmployee(&#39;John Doe&#39;);&quot; +                 &quot;emp.getName()&quot;).asString();        assert name.equals(&quot;John Doe&quot;);                try {            context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;services.exitVM()&quot;);            assert false;        } catch (PolyglotException e) {            assert e.getMessage().endsWith(                    &quot;Unknown identifier: exitVM&quot;);        }    }}// END-SNIPPET}                      JavaScript             In this code:  The class Employee is declared with a field name of type String. Access to the getName method is explicitly allowed by annotating the method with @HostAccess.Export.  The Services class exposes two methods, createEmployee and exitVM. The createEmployee method takes the name of the employee as an argument and creates a new Employee instance. The createEmployee method is annotated with @HostAccess.Export and therefore accessible to the guest application. The exitVM method is not explicitly exported and therefore not accessible.  The main method first creates a new polyglot context in the default configuration, disallowing host access except for methods annotated with @HostAccess.Export.  A new Services instance is created and put into the context as global variable services.  The first evaluated script creates a new employee using the services object and returns its name.  The returned name is asserted to equal the expected name John Doe.  A second script is evaluated that calls the exitVM method on the services object. This fails with a PolyglotException as the exitVM method is not exposed to the guest application.Host access is fully customizable by creating a custom HostAccess policy.Controlling Host Callback Parameter ScopingBy default, a Value lives as long as the corresponding Context.However, it may be desireable to change this default behavior and bind a value to a scope, such that when execution leaves the scope, the value is invalidated.An example for such a scope are guest-to-host callbacks, where a Value may be passed as a callback parameter.We have already seen above how passing callback parameters works with the default HostAccess.EXPLICIT:public class Services {    Value lastResult;    @HostAccess.Export    public void callback(Value result) {        this.lastResult = result;    }    String getResult() {        return this.lastResult.asString();    }}public static void main(String[] args) {    Services s = new Services()    try (Context context = Context.newBuilder().allowHostAccess(HostAccess.EXPLICIT).build()) {        context.getBindings(&quot;js&quot;).putMember(&quot;services&quot;, s);        context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;services.callback(&#39;Hello from JS&#39;);&quot;);        System.out.println(s.getResult());    }}In this example, lastResult maintains a reference to the value from the guest that is stored on the host and remains accessible also after the scope of callback() has ended.However, this is not always desireable, as keeping the value alive may block resources unnecessarily or not reflect the behavior of ephemeral values correctly.For these cases, HostAccess.SCOPED can be used, which changes the default behavior for all callbacks, such that values that are passed as callback parameters are only valid for the duration of the callback.To make the above code work with HostAccess.SCOPED, individual values passed as a callback parameters can be pinned to extend their validity until after the callback returns:public class Services {    Value lastResult;    @HostAccess.Export    void callback(Value result, Value notneeded) {        this.lastResult = result;        this.lastResult.pin();    }    String getResult() {        return this.lastResult.asString();    }}public static void main(String[] args) {    Services s = new Services()    try (Context context = Context.newBuilder().allowHostAccess(HostAccess.SCOPED).build()) {        context.getBindings(&quot;js&quot;).putMember(&quot;services&quot;, s);        context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;services.callback(&#39;Hello from JS&#39;, &#39;foobar&#39;);&quot;);        System.out.println(services.getResult());    }}Alternatively, the entire callback method can opt out from scoping if annotated with @HostAccess.DisableMethodScope, maintaining regular semantics for all parameters of the callback:public class Services {    Value lastResult;    Value metaInfo;    @HostAccess.Export    @HostAccess.DisableMethodScope    void callback(Value result, Value metaInfo) {        this.lastResult = result;        this.metaInfo = metaInfo;    }    String getResult() {        return this.lastResult.asString() + this.metaInfo.asString();    }}public static void main(String[] args) {    Services s = new Services()    try (Context context = Context.newBuilder().allowHostAccess(HostAccess.SCOPED).build()) {        context.getBindings(&quot;js&quot;).putMember(&quot;services&quot;, s);        context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;services.callback(&#39;Hello from JS&#39;, &#39;foobar&#39;);&quot;);        System.out.println(services.getResult());    }}Access Privilege ConfigurationIt is possible to configure fine-grained access privileges for guest applications.The configuration can be provided using the Context.Builder class when constructing a new context.The following access parameters may be configured:  Allow access to other languages using allowPolyglotAccess.  Allow and customize access to host objects using allowHostAccess.  Allow and customize host lookup to host types using allowHostClassLookup. Allows the guest application to look up the host application classes permitted by the lookup predicate. For example, a Javascript context can create a Java ArrayList, provided that ArrayList is allowlisted by the classFilter and access is permitted by the host access policy: context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;var array = Java.type(&#39;java.util.ArrayList&#39;)&quot;)  Allow host class loading using allowHostClassLoading. Classes are only accessible if access to them is granted by the host access policy.  Allow the creation of threads using allowCreateThread.  Allow access to native APIs using allowNativeAccess.  Allow access to IO using allowIO and proxy file accesses using fileSystem.  Note: Granting access to class loading, native APIs, or host I/O effectively grants all access, as these privileges can be used to bypass other access restrictions.Runtime Optimization SupportPolyglot Truffle runtimes can be used on several host virtual machines with varying support for runtime optimization.Runtime optimization of guest application code is crucial for the efficient execution of embedded guest applications.This table shows the level of optimizations the Java runtimes currently provide:            Java Runtime      Runtime Optimization Level                  Oracle GraalVM      Optimized with additional compiler passes              GraalVM Community Edition      Optimized              Oracle JDK      Optimized if enabled via experimental VM option              OpenJDK      Optimized if enabled via experimental VM option              JDK without JVMCI capability      No runtime optimizations (interpreter-only)      Explanations  Optimized: Executed guest application code can be compiled and executed as highly efficient machine code at run time.  Optimized with additional compiler passes: Oracle GraalVM implements additional optimizations performed during run-time compilation. For example, it uses a more advanced inlining heuristic. This typically leads to better run-time performance and memory consumption.  Optimized if enabled via experimental VM option: Optimization is not enabled by default and must be enabled using -XX:+EnableJVMCI virtual machine option. In addition, to support compilation, the Graal compiler must be downloaded as a JAR file and put on the --upgrade-module-path. In this mode, the compiler runs as a Java application and may negatively affect the execution performance of the host application.  No runtime optimizations: With no runtime optimizations or if JVMCI is not enabled, the guest application code is executed in interpreter-only mode.  JVMCI: Refers to the Java-Level JVM Compiler Interface supported by most Java runtimes.A project has been created to enable run-time optimization by default for Oracle JDK and OpenJDK.See Project Galahad for further details.Enable Optimization on OpenJDK and Oracle JDKWhen running on a JDK run-time optimization enabled by default, like OpenJDK, you might see a warning like this:[engine] WARNING: The polyglot engine uses a fallback runtime that does not support runtime compilation to machine code.Execution without runtime compilation will negatively impact the guest application performance.This indicates that the guest application is executed with no runtime optimizations enabled.The warning can be suppressed by either suppressing using the --engine.WarnInterpreterOnly=false option or the -Dpolyglot.engine.WarnInterpreterOnly=false system property.In addition, the compiler.jar and its dependencies must be downloaded from Maven Central and referred to use the option --upgrade-module-path. Note that the compiler jar must not be put on the module or class path. Refer to the polyglot embedding demonstration for an example configuration using Maven or Gradle.Switching to the Fallback EngineIf the need arises, for example, running only trivial scripts or in the resource-constrained systems, you may want to switch to the fallback engine without run-time optimizations.Since Polyglot version 23.1, the fallback engine can be activated by removing the truffle-runtime and truffle-enterprise modules from the class or module path.This can be achieved with Maven like this:&amp;lt;dependencies&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.polyglot&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;js&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;$graalvm-version&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;exclusions&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;exclusion&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.truffle&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;truffle-runtime&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;/exclusion&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;exclusion&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.truffle&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;truffle-enterprise&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;/exclusion&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;/exclusions&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/dependencies&amp;gt;The exclusion rule for truffle-enterprise is unnecessary if you only use -community dependencies.Since truffle-enterprise is excluded, the fallback engine does not support advanced extensions like sandbox limits or polyglot isolates.It may be useful to double-check with mvn dependency:tree that the two dependencies are not included elsewhere.If the runtime was excluded successfully, you should see the following log message:[engine] WARNING: The polyglot engine uses a fallback runtime that does not support runtime compilation to native code.Execution without runtime compilation will negatively impact the guest application performance.The following cause was found: No optimizing Truffle runtime found on the module or class-path.For more information see: https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/embed-languages/.To disable this warning use the &#39;--engine.WarnInterpreterOnly=false&#39; option or the &#39;-Dpolyglot.engine.WarnInterpreterOnly=false&#39; system property.You can disable this message using the indicated options as an additional step.Removing these dependencies also automatically switches to the fallback engine in Native Image builds.Build Native Executables from Polyglot ApplicationsWith Polyglot version 23.1 on GraalVM for JDK 21 and later, no special configuration is required to use Native Image to build images with embedded polyglot language runtimes.Like any other Java dependency, the polyglot language JAR files must be on the class or module path when building a native executable.We recommend to use the Maven or Gradle Native Image plugins to configure your native-image builds.A sample Maven and Gradle configuration for Native Image can be found in the polyglot embedding demonstration repository.Here is a Maven profile configuration example:&amp;lt;profiles&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;profile&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;id&amp;gt;native&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;build&amp;gt;            &amp;lt;plugins&amp;gt;                &amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt;                    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.buildtools&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;                    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;native-maven-plugin&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;                    &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;0.10.1&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;                    &amp;lt;extensions&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/extensions&amp;gt;

                       &amp;lt;/execution&amp;gt;                    &amp;lt;/executions&amp;gt;                    &amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;                        &amp;lt;imageName&amp;gt;${project.artifactId}&amp;lt;/imageName&amp;gt;

                           &amp;lt;buildArg&amp;gt;-J-Xmx20g&amp;lt;/buildArg&amp;gt;                        &amp;lt;/buildArgs&amp;gt;                    &amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;                &amp;lt;/plugin&amp;gt;            &amp;lt;/plugins&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;/build&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;/profile&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/profiles&amp;gt;To build a native executable with the above configuration, run:mvn -Pnative packageTo build a native executable from a polyglot application, for example, a Java-host application embedding Python, a ./resources folder containing all the required files is created by default.By default, the language runtime will look for the resources folder relative to the native executable or library image that was built.At run time, the lookup location may be customized using the -Dpolyglot.engine.resourcePath=path/to/resources option.To disable the resource creation, the -H:-CopyLanguageResources build-time option may be used.Note that some languages may not support running without a resources folder.With Polyglot version 23.1 the language home options like -Dorg.graalvm.home should no longer be used and were replaced with the resource folder option.The language home options remain functional for compatibility reasons but may be removed in future releases.Configuring Native Host ReflectionAccessing host Java code from the guest application requires Java reflection in order to work.When reflection is used within a native executable, the reflection configuration file is required.For this example we use JavaScript to show host access with native executables.Copy the following code in a new file named AccessJavaFromJS.java.import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;import org.graalvm.polyglot.proxy.*;import java.util.concurrent.*;public class AccessJavaFromJS {    public static class MyClass {        public int               id    = 42;        public String            text  = &quot;42&quot;;        public int[]             arr   = new int[]{1, 42, 3};        public Callable&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; ret42 = () -&amp;gt; 42;    }    public static void main(String[] args) {        try (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                                   .allowAllAccess(true)                               .build()) {            context.getBindings(&quot;js&quot;).putMember(&quot;javaObj&quot;, new MyClass());            boolean valid = context.eval(&quot;js&quot;,                   &quot;    javaObj.id         == 42&quot;          +                   &quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; javaObj.text       == &#39;42&#39;&quot;        +                   &quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; javaObj.arr[1]     == 42&quot;          +                   &quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; javaObj.ret42()    == 42&quot;)               .asBoolean();            System.out.println(&quot;Valid &quot; + valid);        }    }}Copy the following code into reflect.json:[  { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;AccessJavaFromJS$MyClass&quot;, &quot;allPublicFields&quot;: true },  { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;java.util.concurrent.Callable&quot;, &quot;allPublicMethods&quot;: true }]Now, you can create a native executable that supports host access and add the additional -H:ReflectionConfigurationFiles=reflect.json build-time option.Code Caching Across Multiple ContextsThe GraalVM Polyglot API allows code caching across multiple contexts.Code caching allows compiled code to be reused and allows sources to be parsed only once.Code caching can often reduce memory consumption and warm-up time of the application.By default, code is cached within a single context instance only.An explicit engine needs to be specified to enable code caching between multiple contexts.The engine is specified when creating the context using the context builder.The engine instance determines the scope of code sharing.Code is only shared between contexts associated with one engine instance.All sources are cached by default.Caching may be disabled explicitly by setting cached(boolean cached) to false. Disabling caching may be useful in case the source is known to only be evaluated once.Consider the following code snippet as an example:public class Main {    public static void main(String[] args) {        try (Engine engine = Engine.create()) {            Source source = Source.create(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;21 + 21&quot;);            try (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                .engine(engine)                .build()) {                    int v = context.eval(source).asInt();                    assert v == 42;            }            try (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                .engine(engine)                .build()) {                    int v = context.eval(source).asInt();                    assert v == 42;            }        }    }}In this code:  import org.graalvm.polyglot.* imports the base API for the Polyglot API.  Engine.create() creates a new engine instance with the default configuration.  Source.create() creates a source object for the expression “21 + 21”. We use an explicit Source object to ensure the code cache does not get garbage collected between contexts.with “js” language, which is the language identifier for JavaScript.  Context.newBuilder().engine(engine).build() builds a new context withan explicit engine assigned to it. All contexts associated with an engine share the code.  context.eval(source).asInt() evaluates the source and returns the result as Value instance.Important: To keep the code cache of a cached source alive between executing contexts, the application must ensure that the Source object is continually referenced.The polyglot runtime may collect cached code of sources no longer referenced with the next GC cycle.Managing the Code CacheThe data for the code cache is stored as part of the Engine instance.There is never any code sharing happening between two separate engine instances.Hence, we recommend using a singleton Engine instance if a global code cache is needed.As opposed to contexts, engines can always be shared across multiple threads.Whether contexts can be shared across multiple threads depends on the language used.There is no explicit method to purge the code cache.We rely on the garbage collector to do this automatically with the next collection.The code cache of an engine is not collected as long as the engine is still strongly referenced and not closed.Also, the Source instance must be kept alive to ensure the associated code is not collected.If a source instance is no longer referenced, but the engine is still referenced, the code cache associated with a source object may be collected by the GC.We recommend, therefore, keeping a strong reference to the Source object as long as Source should remain cached.To summarize, the code cache can be controlled by keeping and maintaining strong references to the Engine and Source objects.Polyglot IsolatesOn Oracle GraalVM, a Polyglot engine can be configured to run in a dedicated Native Image isolate.A polyglot engine in this mode executes within a VM-level fault domain with a dedicated garbage collector and JIT compiler.Polyglot isolates are useful for polyglot sandboxing.Running languages in an isolate works with HotSpot and Native Image host virtual machines.Languages used as polyglot isolates can be downloaded from Maven Central using the -isolate suffix.For example, a dependency on isolated JavaScript can be configured by adding a Maven dependency like this:&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.polyglot&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;polyglot&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;24.0.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;jar&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.polyglot&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;js-isolate&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;24.0.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;pom&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;The downloaded dependency is platform-independent, which contains a native-image for each platform.We plan to support downloading polyglot isolate native images for individual platforms in a future release.To enable isolate usage with the Polyglot API, the --engine.SpawnIsolate=true option must be passed to Engine or Context when constructed.The option engine.SpawnIsolate may not be available if used on any other JDK than Oracle GraalVM.import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;public class PolyglotIsolate {public static void main(String[] args) {try (Context context = Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;)  .allowHostAccess(HostAccess.SCOPED)  .option(&quot;engine.SpawnIsolate&quot;, &quot;true&quot;).build()) {  Value function = context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;x =&amp;gt; x+1&quot;);assert function.canExecute();int x = function.execute(41).asInt();assert x == 42;}}}Currently, the following languages are available as polyglot isolates:            Language      Available from                  JavaScript (js-isolate)      23.1      We plan to add support for more languages in future versions.In the previous example, we enable scoped references using HostAccess.SCOPED.This is necessary because the host GC and the guest GC are unaware of one another, so cyclic references between objects cannot be resolved automatically.We thus strongly recommend using scoped parameters for host callbacks to avoid cyclic references altogether.Multiple contexts can be spawned in the same isolated engine by sharing engines:public class PolyglotIsolateMultipleContexts {    public static void main(String[] args) {        try (Engine engine = Engine.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;)                .option(&quot;engine.SpawnIsolate&quot;, &quot;true&quot;).build()) {            Source source = Source.create(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;21 + 21&quot;);            try (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                .engine(engine)                .build()) {                    int v = context.eval(source).asInt();                    assert v == 42;            }            try (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                .engine(engine)                .build()) {                    int v = context.eval(source).asInt();                    assert v == 42;            }        }    }}Passing Native Image Runtime OptionsEngines running in an isolate can make use of Native Image runtime options by passing --engine.IsolateOption.&amp;lt;option&amp;gt; to the engine builder.For example, this can be used to limit the maximum heap memory used by an engine by setting the maximum heap size for the isolate via --engine.IsolateOption.MaxHeapSize=128m:import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;public class PolyglotIsolateMaxHeap {  public static void main(String[] args) {    try {      Context context = Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;)        .allowHostAccess(HostAccess.SCOPED)        .option(&quot;engine.SpawnIsolate&quot;, &quot;true&quot;)        .option(&quot;engine.IsolateOption.MaxHeapSize&quot;, &quot;64m&quot;).build()      context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;var a = [];while (true) {a.push(&#39;foobar&#39;);}&quot;);    } catch (PolyglotException ex) {      if (ex.isResourceExhausted()) {        System.out.println(&quot;Resource exhausted&quot;);      }    }  }}Exceeding the maximum heap size will automatically close the context and raise a PolyglotException.Ensuring Host Callback Stack HeadroomWith Polyglot Isolates, the --engine.HostCallStackHeadRoom ensures a minimum stack space available when performing a host callback.The host callback fails if the available stack size drops below the specified threshold.Memory ProtectionIn Linux environments that support Memory Protection Keys, the --engine.MemoryProtection=true option can be used to isolate the heaps of Polyglot Isolates at the hardware level.If an engine is created with this option, a dedicated protection key will be allocated for the isolated engine’s heap.GraalVM only enables access to the engine’s heap when executing code of the Polyglot Isolate.Embed Guest Languages in JavaThe GraalVM Polyglot API can be used from within a guest language using Java interoperability.This can be useful if a script needs to run isolated from the parent context.In Java as a host language a call to Context.eval(Source) returns an instance of Value, but since we executing this code as part of a guest language we can use the language-specific interoperability API instead.It is therefore possible to use values returned by contexts created inside of a language, like regular values of the language.In the example below we can conveniently write value.data instead of value.getMember(&quot;data&quot;).Please refer to the individual language documentation for details on how to interoperate with foreign values.More information on value sharing between multiple contexts can be found here.Consider the following code snippet as an example:import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;public class Main {    public static void main(String[] args) {        try (Context outer = Context.newBuilder()                                   .allowAllAccess(true)                               .build()) {            outer.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;inner = Java.type(&#39;org.graalvm.polyglot.Context&#39;).create()&quot;);            outer.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;value = inner.eval(&#39;js&#39;, &#39;({data:42})&#39;)&quot;);            int result = outer.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;value.data&quot;).asInt();            outer.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;inner.close()&quot;);            System.out.println(&quot;Valid &quot; + (result == 42));        }    }}In this code:  Context.newBuilder().allowAllAccess(true).build() builds a new outer context with all privileges.  outer.eval evaluates a JavaScript snippet in the outer context.  inner = Java.type(&#39;org.graalvm.polyglot.Context&#39;).create() the first JS script line looks up the Java host type Context and creates a new inner context instance with no privileges (default).  inner.eval(&#39;js&#39;, &#39;({data:42})&#39;); evaluates the JavaScript code ({data:42}) in the inner context and returns stores the result.  &quot;value.data&quot; this line reads the member data from the result of the inner context. Note that this result can only be read as long as the inner context is not yet closed.  context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;c.close()&quot;) this snippet closes the inner context. Inner contexts need to be closed manually and are not automatically closed with the parent context.  Finally the example is expected to print Valid true to the console.Build a Shell for Many LanguagesWith just a few lines of code, the GraalVM Polyglot API lets you build applications that integrate with any guest language supported by GraalVM.This shell implementation is agnostic to any particular guest language.BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));PrintStream output = System.out;Context context = Context.newBuilder().allowAllAccess(true).build();Set&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; languages = context.getEngine().getLanguages().keySet();output.println(&quot;Shell for &quot; + languages + &quot;:&quot;);String language = languages.iterator().next();for (;;) {    try {        output.print(language + &quot;&amp;gt; &quot;);        String line = input.readLine();        if (line == null) {            break;        } else if (languages.contains(line)) {            language = line;            continue;        }        Source source = Source.newBuilder(language, line, &quot;&amp;lt;shell&amp;gt;&quot;)                        .interactive(true).buildLiteral();        context.eval(source);    } catch (PolyglotException t) {        if(t.isExit()) {            break;        }        t.printStackTrace();    }}Step Through with Execution ListenersThe GraalVM Polyglot API allows users to instrument the execution of guest languages through ExecutionListener class.For example, it lets you attach an execution listener that is invoked for every statement of the guest language program.Execution listeners are designed as simple API for polyglot embedders and may become handy in, e.g., single-stepping through the program.import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;import org.graalvm.polyglot.management.*;public class ExecutionListenerTest {    public static void main(String[] args) {        try (Context context = Context.create(&quot;js&quot;)) {            ExecutionListener listener = ExecutionListener.newBuilder()                      .onEnter((e) -&amp;gt; System.out.println(                              e.getLocation().getCharacters()))                      .statements(true)                      .attach(context.getEngine());            context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; 2; i++);&quot;);            listener.close();        }    }}In this code:  The Context.create() call creates a new context for the guest language.  Create an execution listener builder by invoking ExecutionListeners.newBuilder().  Set onEnter event to notify when element’s execution is entered and consumed. At least one event consumer and one filtered source element needs to be enabled.  To complete the listener attachment, attach() needs to be invoked.  The statements(true) filters execution listeners to statements only.  The context.eval() call evaluates a specified snippet of guest language code.  The listener.close() closes a listener earlier, however execution listeners are automatically closed with the engine.Compatibility with JSR-223 ScriptEngineThe Truffle language implementation framework does not provide a JSR-223 ScriptEngine implementation.The Polyglot API provides more fine-grained control over Truffle features and we strongly encourage users to use the org.graalvm.polyglot.Context interface in order to control many of the settings directly and benefit from finer-grained security settings in GraalVM.However, to easily evaluate a Truffle language as a replacement for other scripting languages that are integrated using the ScriptEngine API, we provide a single file script engine below.This file can be dropped into a source tree and used directly to evaluate a Truffle language via the ScriptEngine APIs.There are only two lines to adapt to your project:public final class CHANGE_NAME_EngineFactory implements ScriptEngineFactory {    private static final String LANGUAGE_ID = &quot;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;INSERT LANGUAGE ID HERE&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&quot;;Rename the class as desired and change the LANGUAGE_ID to the desired Truffle language (e.g. “python” for GraalPy or “ruby” for TruffleRuby). To use it, include a META-INF/services/javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory file in your resources with the chosen class name.This will allow the default javax.script.ScriptEngineManager to discover the language automatically.Alternatively, the factory can be registerd via javax.script.ScriptEngineManager#registerEngineName or instantiated and used directly.The best practice is to close the ScriptEngine when no longer used rather than relying on finalizers.To close it, use ((AutoCloseable) scriptEngine).close(); since ScriptEngine does not have a close() method.Note that Graal.js provides a ScriptEngine implementation for users migrating from the Nashorn JavaScript engine that was deprecated in JDK 11, so this method here is not needed.Expand to see the ScriptEngineFactory implementation for Truffle languages in a single file.import java.io.IOException;import java.io.InputStream;import java.io.InputStreamReader;import java.io.OutputStream;import java.io.OutputStreamWriter;import java.io.Reader;import java.io.Writer;import java.util.ArrayList;import java.util.Collection;import java.util.HashSet;import java.util.List;import java.util.Map;import java.util.Map.Entry;import java.util.Set;import javax.script.Bindings;import javax.script.Compilable;import javax.script.CompiledScript;import javax.script.Invocable;import javax.script.ScriptContext;import javax.script.ScriptEngine;import javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory;import javax.script.ScriptException;import org.graalvm.home.Version;import org.graalvm.polyglot.Context;import org.graalvm.polyglot.Engine;import org.graalvm.polyglot.Language;import org.graalvm.polyglot.PolyglotException;import org.graalvm.polyglot.Source;import org.graalvm.polyglot.Value;public final class CHANGE_NAME_EngineFactory implements ScriptEngineFactory {    private static final String LANGUAGE_ID = &quot;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&quot;;

By creating GitHub pull requests.See how to become a GraalVM contributor.If you wish to contribute to the documentation, please check this guide.How Can I Receive Updates about GraalVM?We maintain three mailing lists:  graalvm-announce@oss.oracle.com – a low traffic announcement list used by the project maintainers;  graalvm-users@oss.oracle.com – an open source user mailing list for general questions and discussions;  graalvm-dev@oss.oracle.com – a list for contributors and language implementors.Additional ways to stay up-to-date with GraalVM development are to track GraalVM at the Medium blogging platform, follow the @graalvm Twitter handle, or watch the github.com/oracle/graal repository.How Do I Get Support Updates?Comprehensive Oracle GraalVM support is provided by the Oracle GraalVM team via My Oracle Support.Please verify if support services are activated with your account.What is the GraalVM Release Schedule?Starting with JDK 20 in June 2023, GraalVM will follow the JDK’s six-month release cadence. In addition, starting with JDK 20, GraalVM releases will only support the latest JDK version (just as Oracle OpenJDK releases do). This will simplify the choice of versions and ensure that developers have access to the latest Java features with each GraalVM release.Check the GraalVM release calendar.As part of this alignment, GraalVM will adopt the JDK’s release numbering scheme based on the supported Java version. To avoid confusion with older releases, new releases will be named GraalVM for JDK &amp;lt;Java version&amp;gt;, for example GraalVM for JDK 20.What Are the Available Distributions of GraalVM?GraalVM is available as Oracle GraalVM and GraalVM Community Edition.Oracle GraalVM is based on Oracle JDK, whereas GraalVM Community Edition is based on OpenJDK.Oracle GraalVM can be downloaded from Oracle Java Downloads.GraalVM Community Edition can be obtained from GraalVM releases on GitHub.There are also downstream distributions of GraalVM Community Edition from:  Bellsoft Liberica Native Image Kit  RedHat MandrelWhich Microservice Frameworks Employ GraalVM Native Image?Several Java microservice frameworks have accepted the GraalVM Native Image technology as a platform.Examples include: Micronaut, Spring, Helidon, and Quarkus.For these frameworks Native Image significantly reduces the startup time and runtime memory requirements.See Frameworks Ready for Native Image.Will GraalVM be Part of OpenJDK?Oracle announced in October 2022 that it is contributing the most applicable portions of the GraalVM just-in-time compiler and Native Image to OpenJDK to more closely align the development of the GraalVM technologies with that of Java.To deliver on the announcements, a new project Galahad has been proposed. Galahad will initially focus on the continued development and integration of the Graal just-in-time (JIT) compiler as an alternative to the existing HotSpot JIT compiler for possible inclusion in a future OpenJDK release. Later steps will target contributions related to the GraalVM Native Image technology, which will make it possible to compile the Graal JIT compiler ahead-of-time (AOT) so that it is available instantly at JVM start.Are There Existing Real-World Production Deployments of GraalVM?Several production deployments of GraalVM exist today.See the Use Cases section on GraalVM’s home page.We thank early adopters of our technology who give us feedback on the project and help us develop new features.",

          "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
          "content": "Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat is TruffleRuby?TruffleRuby is a high-performance implementation of the Ruby programming language built on GraalVM using the Truffle languageimplementation framework and the GraalVM compiler.TruffleRuby is one part of GraalVM, a platform for high-performance polyglot programming.What is Truffle?The Truffle language implementation framework is a Java framework for writing AST interpreters.To implement a language using Truffle, you write an AST for your language and add methods to interpret – perform the action of – each node.Truffle also incorporates the concept of specialization.In most AST interpreters the nodes are megamorphic – they handle all possible types and other possible conditions.In the Truffle framework you write several different nodes for the same semantic action, but for different types and conditions.As runtime conditions change, you switch which nodes you are using.After the program has warmed up you should end up with an AST that is precisely tailored for the types and conditions that you are actually using.If these conditions change, you can just switch nodes again.What is the GraalVM compiler?The GraalVM compiler is a new implementation of a just-in-time compiler (JIT compiler, or we’d normally say dynamic compiler) in the OpenJDK Java Virtual Machine.Unlike the current compilers, Graal is written in Java, and exposes a Java API to the running program.This means that instead of emitting bytecode, a JVM language can directly control the compiler.However this is complicated, so normally the Truffle framework uses the GraalVM compiler on your behalf to partially evaluate your AST interpreter into machine code.What is GraalVM?GraalVM is the platform on which TruffleRuby runs. It is a system for high-performance polyglot programming.More concretely, GraalVM is a JDK (Java Development Kit) with extra components like the GraalVM compiler and GraalVM Native Image.The GraalVM compiler and GraalVM Native Image are then used by Truffle languages like TruffleRuby.How do I get TruffleRuby?There are multiple ways to install TruffleRuby, see Getting Started.Why is TruffleRuby slow on a standard JVM?The expected way to run TruffleRuby is using the GraalVM compiler.TruffleRuby isn’t designed to be efficient on a JVM without this.Why is TruffleRuby faster on the GraalVM?When running with the GraalVM compiler, the Truffle framework can use the API exposed by the GraalVM compiler.The Truffle framework gets the bytecode representation of all of the AST interpreter methods involved in running your Ruby method, combines them into something like a single Java method, optimizes them together, and emits a single machine code function.The Truffle framework also provides wrappers for JVM functionality not normally available to Java applications, such as code deoptimization.TruffleRuby uses this to provide a dramatically simpler and faster implementation of Ruby.Where did this code come from?Chris Seaton wrote an implementation of Ruby on Truffle and Graal as part of an internship at Oracle Labs in the first half of 2013. The code was merged into JRuby in early 2014. Benoit Daloze and Kevin Menard joined as researchers in the second half of 2014, then Petr Chalupa in 2015, Brandon Fish in 2016, and Duncan MacGregor in 2017.Since then we have also accepted contributions from people outside Oracle Labs.In 2017 the code was forked back out of JRuby after it had matured.Who do I ask about TruffleRuby?See the Contact section of this README page.How do I know if I’m using TruffleRuby?RUBY_ENGINE will be &#39;truffleruby&#39;.How do I know if I’m using a VM that has the GraalVM compiler?ruby --version will report GraalVM CE or Oracle GraalVM.TruffleRuby versions before 23.0 report GraalVM EE instead of Oracle GraalVM.Also, TruffleRuby.jit? will tell you if you are running with the GraalVM compiler.What is Oracle GraalVM?Oracle GraalVM is the GraalVM distribution from Oracle available under the GraalVM Free Terms and Conditions.Oracle GraalVM provides the best TruffleRuby experience: it is significantly faster and more memory-efficient than GraalVM Community Edition.How do I know that I’m using the Community Edition of GraalVM?ruby --version will report GraalVM CE.How do I know that I’m using Oracle GraalVM?ruby --version will report Oracle GraalVM.TruffleRuby versions before 23.0 report GraalVM EE instead.How do I know that I’m using the native version of TruffleRuby?ruby --version will report Native.TruffleRuby.native? will return true.How can I see the GraalVM compiler is working?Put this program into test.rb:loop do  14 + 2endWe’ll use the --engine.TraceCompilation to ask the Truffle framework to tell us when it compiles something using the GraalVM compiler.ruby --engine.TraceCompilation test.rb[truffle] opt done         block in &amp;lt;main&amp;gt; test.rb:1 &amp;lt;opt&amp;gt; &amp;lt;split-3a9ffa1b&amp;gt;         |ASTSize       8/    8 |Time   103(  99+4   )ms |DirectCallNodes I    0/D    0 |GraalNodes    24/    3 |CodeSize           69 |CodeAddress 0x11245cf50 |Source   ../test.rb:1Here you can see that Truffle has decided to use the GraalVM compiler to compile the block of 127 - the loop to machine code - just 69 bytes of machine code in all.Why doesn’t TruffleRuby perform well for my benchmark?Benchmarks that we haven’t looked at yet may require new code paths to be specialized.Currently we’ve added specialization for the code paths in the benchmarks and applications that we’ve been using.Adding them is generally not complicated and over time we will have specializations to cover a broad range of applications.Make sure that you are using Oracle GraalVM for the best performance.How is this related to invokedynamic?TruffleRuby doesn’t use invokedynamic, as it doesn’t emit bytecode.However it does have an optimizing method dispatch mechanism that achieves a similar result.Why doesn’t JRuby switch to Truffle as well?JRuby is taking a different approach to optimizing and adding new functionality to Ruby.Both JRuby and TruffleRuby are important projects.Why did you fork from JRuby?We merged into JRuby in order to be able to use large parts of their Java implementation code.We forked back out of JRuby when we had reached the point where the code that we were using needed to be modified for our purposes and we no longer had any dependency on the core part of JRuby.Forking also allowed us to simplify our code base.",

See OpenJDK 17 Updates.  Simplified the GraalVM package naming: it is graalvm-community-jdk-&amp;lt;full java version&amp;gt;_&amp;lt;platform&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;arch&amp;gt;, for example: graalvm-community-jdk-17.0.7_macos-aarch64_bin.tar.gz.Java and Compiler Updates  Added support for the ZGC garbage collector for workloads that require low latency or use a very large heap size. See #2149.  Strengthened the optimistic aliasing analysis by adding a non-speculative mode. (Improves loop vectorization.) Some code shapes were previously only vectorized in JIT, but not in ahead-of-time compilations. With the improved loop vectorization for Native Image, the differences in those code shapes are gone, allowing the compiler to vectorize more loops for faster execution.  Improved logging of the novel optimization compiler phase: unified interface to log and dump (for example, via JSON) optimization decisions. Optimization phases should use OptimizationLog to log transformations. Read more in OptimizationLog.md and Profdiff.md to learn how to compare performed optimizations in hot compilations.  Open-sourced Ideal Graph Visualizer (IGV) to make it easier for third-party compilers and language developers to use and contribute to it. See more here.See more updates in the changelog.Native ImagePackaging and Platform Updates  Native Image is now shipped as part of GraalVM for JDK 17, and no longer needs to be installed via gu install native-image. Read more here.  Native Image now sets build environments on Windows automatically if it can find a Visual Studio installation in a known location. Therefore, running in an x64 Native Tools Command Prompt is no longer a requirement.  Improved dynamic linking of AWT libraries on Linux. Static linking of AWT libraries on Linux has been a constant source of problems. Dynamic linking avoids the pitfalls of static linking at the expense of no longer having standalone binaries, which is a reasonable trade-off as shown by AWT support on Windows. The linker should no longer fail because of “multiple definitions of jvm”, or crash at the linking step for an AWS/Swing application on Linux.  Jipher JCE, a Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) provider implemented on top of OpenSSL 3.0 FIPS, now supports GraalVM Native Image. It is recommended to enable Jipher with Native Image in contexts where only FIPS-allowed algorithms should be used. See the documentation to get started.New Features  Introduced a new feature: building a native executable from a self-contained bundle on demand. The new option --bundle-create=&amp;lt;imagename&amp;gt;.nib creates a &amp;lt;imagename&amp;gt;.nib file (a build bundle) and the launch.output directory alongside a native executable. The bundle file, &amp;lt;imagename&amp;gt;.nib, is a regular JAR file that contains all information required to build a native executable (or a native shared library). In contrast to regular native-image building, this mode of operation takes only a single *.nib file as an input. At any time later, if the same version of GraalVM is used, the executable can be rebuilt with:    native-image --bundle-apply=.../path/to/launch.nib    It will rebuild the native executable with the same image arguments, environment variables, system properties, classpath, and module-path options as in the initial build. It is a safe and reliable solution to encapsulate all the input required for building into a single file. Learn more in the Native Image Bundles reference manual.    Improved the memory footprint of the Native Image build process. The builder now takes available memory into account to reduce memory pressure when many other processes are running on the same machine. It also consumes less memory in many cases and is therefore also less likely to fail due to out-of-memory errors. At the same time, the memory limit was raised from 14GB to 32GB.  Native Image now targets x86-64-v3 architecture by default on AMD64 and provides a new -march option to specify target compatibility. Use -march=compatibility for best compatibility or -march=native for best performance if a native executable is deployed on the same machine or on a machine with the same CPU features. To list all available machine types, use -march=list.  Improved reporting of missing metadata in Native Image by throwing special exceptions. Native Image does not distinguish between missing reachability metadata and exceptions that were thrown by the Reflection API. For example, the ClassNotFoundException that is thrown when a class is not on the classpath, or when the metadata for a class is not present. Now Native Image users can catch metadata exceptions and debug their programs using the option -XX:ExitOnMissingMetadata to guarantee that all metadata entries are correct. Read more here. This is an experimental feature and is not enabled by default.  Introduced safe composition of Reflection and Resources metadata in Native Image. For example, reflective methods such as java.lang.Class#getDeclaredMethodsreturn are based on the reachability of other reflective elements. Adding new metadata makes more elements reachable and can change the program functionality. Thanks to the safe composition of metadata optimization, the native-image builder now ensures that every reflective call on java.lang.Class requires a metadata entry. Read more here.  Disallowed the --initialize-at-build-time option without arguments. As a temporary workaround, the -H:+AllowDeprecatedInitializeAllClassesAtBuildTime option turns this error into a warning.  Added an experimental RISC-V mode for Native Image through the LLVM backend. Read more in this blog post.  Improved Profile-Guided Optimizations (PGO) in Native Image (PGO is not available in GraalVM Community Edition):          Profile-guided optimizations have a new sampling profiler that collect call stacks periodically. Use the option --pgo-sampling to turn on the sampling profiler and collect call stacks. This data is then included in the .iprof file. When the PGO-instrumented executable is built, the sampling profiler turned on by default (but can be turned off with the option -H:-SamplingCollect). To get good profiles and therefore good peak performance, you need to run relevant workloads and properly warm up the application.      Implemented the Context-Aware Inliner (CAI) optimization which specializes in sampling profiles in the “hot” code, and invests more optimization effort into hot-compilation units. When the optimized image is built for PGO, the Context-Aware Inliner is automatically turned on (but can be turned off with the option -H:-AOTInliner). The results are 2-7% smaller executable sizes, and increased peak performance.      Improved merging profiles and enabled pre-packaged profiles.        Added Machine Learning (ML) based profile inference. When profiling is disabled, the Graal compiler in Native Image uses a pre-trained ML model to infer the profiles of the control split branches. Then, inferred profiles are used to perform the profile-guided optimizations. In some benchmarks such as Renaissance, Da Capo, and Da Capo con Scala, this optimization provides ~6% runtime speedup compared to the default Oracle GraalVM configuration. By running the native executable build with the ML profile inference, you can expect a slight binary size increase of 1%-2%.This optimization is enabled by default in Oracle GraalVM (not available in GraalVM Community Edition). To disable it, use the following option: -H:-MLProfileInference.  Native Image SBOMs now include a single SBOM component for runtime components. This component uses the java.vm.version property of the executable to identify the version and belongs to the new graalvm-native-image product.Build Output Improvements  The builder now can generate build reports that help you better understand the contents of your executables. Use -H:+BuildReport to try this new experimental feature.  Improved reporting of internal errors to be more user-friendly. A clear message tells users how to proceed: inspect the error report and, if unable to resolve the problem, file an issue with the error report. Inspired by HotSpot, the default filename for error reports is ./svm_err_b_&amp;lt;timestamp&amp;gt;_pid&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;.md. This also adds a new option -H:ErrorFile to let you choose a different filename for error reports. See #5414.  Adjusted the native-image build output to report types (primitives, classes, interfaces, and arrays) instead of classes and revise the output schema of -H:BuildOutputJSONFile.  The output of the native-image --version command and various Java properties (for example, java.vm.version) are aligned with OpenJDK. To distinguish between GraalVM Community Edition, Oracle GraalVM, and GraalVM distributions from other vendors, refer to java.vm.vendor.Debugging and Monitoring Experience Improvements  Deprecated using the option --enable-monitoring without an argument. The option no longer defaults to all. Instead, always explicitly specify the list of monitoring features to be enabled, for example, --enable-monitoring=heapdump,jfr,jvmstat.  Added the option -XX:HeapDumpPath to control where a heap dumps is created.  Added more JFR events for application monitoring: ExecutionSample, ObjectAllocationInNewTLAB, and JavaMonitorInflate.  Improved debugging on Windows: debug information now includes information about Java types. (Together with Red Hat.)  Implemented the remote management over JMX to Native Image which can be enabled with the option --enable-monitoring, for example: --enable-monitoring=jmxclient,jmxserver. Read more here. The feature is experimental. (Together with Red Hat.)  Enabled the JFR event streaming for Native Image. The feature is experimental. (Together with Red Hat.)Find many more updates in the Native Image changelog.JavaScript and Node.js  Updated Node.js to version 18.14.1.  Added BigInteger interoperability support. Note that foreign BigIntegers require an explicit type cast using the BigInt function to opt into JS BigInt semantics. The default semantics is to treat all foreign numbers like JavaScript Number values, regardless of the original value or type. Arithmetic operators perform an implicit lossy conversion to double. Comparison operators attempt to do a precise value comparison where possible. JavaScript BigInt values can now be converted to java.math.BigInteger host objects, although a target type mapping may still be necessary to ensure consistent type mapping if the target type is ambiguous or absent.  Implemented several new ECMAScript proposals in the GraalVM JavaScript runtime:          The Iterator Helpers proposal. It is available behind the experimental option --js.iterator-helpers.      The ShadowRealm API proposal. It is available behind the experimental option --js.shadow-realm.      The Symbols as WeakMap keys proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode, ()--js.ecmascript-version=staging).      The ArrayBuffer.prototype.transfer and friends proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (--js.ecmascript-version=staging).      The Change Array by copy proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (--js.ecmascript-version=staging).      Find more updates in the project changelog.Polyglot Embedding  This is the first release that supports running untrusted applications in a code sandbox. The sandbox policy Context.Builder#sandbox(SandboxPolicy) with four different levels of sandboxing, ISOLATED, UNTRUSTED, TRUSTED, and CONSTRAINED, was implemented to enable users to establish a security boundary between a host application and guest code. The policy is set by passing it to the Engine.Builder#sandbox(SandboxPolicy) or Context.Builder#sandbox(SandboxPolicy) builder method. A host code can execute untrusted guest code using, for example, the UNTRUSTED policy. Host code can also execute multiple mutually distrusting instances of guest code that will be protected from one another. Learn more in the polyglot sandboxing guide. Code sandboxing is currently only supported for Javascript. The SandboxPolicy.ISOLATED and SandboxPolicy.UNTRUSTED policies are not available in GraalVM Community Edition.  Related to the code sandbox implementation, a new option TraceLimits was added to measure a guest application’s resource consumption and obtain realistic sandbox parameters.  Added the IOAccess API: the IO access configuration of a polyglot context. The IO access configuration determines how a guest language can access the host IO. The new IOAccess class provides a predefined configuration to disable host IO access, or to enable full host IO access. A custom configuration can be created using an IOAccess builder.  Added java.lang.BigInteger to the Polyglot Value API. By default, all host values of the type java.lang.BigInteger are now interpreted as number values (Value.isNumber()), unlike before. In order to restore the old behavior, set HostAccess.Builder.allowBigIntegerNumberAccess(boolean) to false. Note that the language support for interpreting numbers that do not fit into long values may vary. Some languages, such as JavaScript, may require explicit conversions of host big integers. Other languages, such as Ruby or Python, can use big integers without explicit conversion. The same applies to values passed across guest languages. See #2737.  Added automatic copying of language resources for embedding Truffle languages in Native Image. The documentation is available here.A full list of changes is available in the changelog.Truffle Language and Tool Implementations  Implemented several new features for Truffle DSL to improve performance. In particular, a new annotation called @GenerateInline was introduced which allows Truffle nodes to be object-inlined automatically. Object-inlined Truffle nodes become singletons and therefore reduce memory footprint. This works analogously to @GenerateCached and @GenerateUncached, which generate a cached or uncached node version. Please see the documentation for further details.Other updates contributing to performance improvements are:  Updated Truffle DSL nodes no longer require the node lock during specialization, resulting in improved first execution performance. CAS-style inline cache updates are now used to avoid deadlocks when calling CallTarget.call(...) in guards. Inline caches continue to guarantee no duplicate values and are not affected by race conditions. Language implementations should be aware that the reduced contention may reveal other thread-safety issues in the language.  Improved Truffle DSL node memory footprint by merging generated fields for state and excluding bit sets and improving specialization data class generation to consider activation probability. Specializations should be ordered by activation probability for optimal results.  Improved memory footprint by automatically inlining cached parameter values of enum types into the state bitset.  Truffle DSL now emits many more warnings for recommendations. For example, it emits warnings for inlining opportunities, cached sharing or when a cache initializer should be designated as @NeverDefault. To ease migration work, new ways to suppress the warnings temporarily for a Java package were added. For a list of possible warnings and further usage instructions, see the documentation.  Unclosed polyglot engines are no longer closed automatically on VM shutdown. They die with the VM. As a result, TruffleInstrument#onDispose is not called for active instruments on unclosed engines in the event of VM shutdown. In case an instrument is supposed to do some specific action before its disposal, for example, print some kind of summary, it should be done in TruffleInstrument#onFinalize.  Implemented the policies to control the restriction of code sandboxing. By default, languages and instruments support just the TRUSTED sandbox policy.          If a language wants to target a more restrictive sandbox policy, it must:                  Specify the most strict sandbox policy it satisfies using TruffleLanguage.Registration#sandbox().          For each option, the language must specify the most restrictive sandbox policy in which the option can be used via Option#sandbox(). By default, options have a TRUSTED sandbox policy.          If a language needs additional validation, it can use TruffleLanguage.Env#getSandboxPolicy() to obtain the current context sandbox policy.                    If an instrument wants to target a more restrictive sandbox policy, it must:                  Specify the most strict sandbox policy it satisfies using TruffleInstrument.Registration#sandbox().          For each option, the instrument must specify the most restrictive sandbox policy in which the option can be used via Option#sandbox(). By default, options have a TRUSTED sandbox policy.          If an instrument needs additional validation, it can use TruffleInstrument.Env#getSandboxPolicy() to obtain the engine’s sandbox policy.                    Find many more updates in the Truffle changelog.Java on Truffle (Espresso)New features:  The Truffle InteropLibrary has/getMetaParents API is now fully implemented.  Enabled foreign Instant, TimeZone, Time, Date, Duration when calling espresso via interop.Improvements:  Enabled calling overloaded and Varargs methods through interop.  Improved interoperability with foreign exceptions. A stack trace is now available and type mapping can be used to explicitly map exceptions.PythonPerformance Improvements:  Added a new implementation of the Python C API interface that uses fully native execution by default. This improves performance and compatibility with some extensions that spend a lot of time in native code (such as SciPy, PyTorch, …) but can have negative effects on workloads that frequently cross the Python/native boundary. There are new options to control how extensions are built and run: python.NativeModules and python.UseSystemToolchain. The new default is to use the host system’s toolchain for building extensions rather than the LLVM toolchain that ships with GraalVM and to run all modules natively. A new launcher (graalpy-lt) is available to get the old behavior, which can be useful for debugging.  The performance numbers we report on the website are now based on results from the community’s pyperformance benchmark suite, measuring GraalPy geomean speedup over CPython and Jython. This makes it easier to compare and reproduce our results.Platform Updates:  Implemented building and running basic GraalPy workloads on Windows. This enables Windows users to build and use GraalPy, especially for embedding into Java.  Added GraalPy plugin for Virtualenv as a builtin module, so that creating virtual environments with virtualenv on GraalPy works out of the box.  Updated the builtin venv module to create virtual environments with symlinks instead of generated shell scripts that are delegated to the base GraalPy.Compatibility Improvements:  Updated language version and the standard library to 3.10.8, making it compatible with more recent modules and packages.  Updated the distribution layout of GraalPy to match CPython’s. This reduces the number of patches needed for various build systems to discover GraalPy’s library locations.  Updated numpy and pandas versions.  Implemented scipy and scikit_learn with ginstall.A full list of updates can be found in the project changelog.RubyNew features:  Updated to Ruby 3.1.3.  Foreign big integers are now supported and work with all Numeric operators.Performance:  Made the system libyaml for psych to be used which improves warmup when parsing YAML. This means libyaml is now a dependency. See how to install LibYAML.  Marking of native structures wrapped in objects is now done on the C call exit to reduce memory overhead.  Optimized splitting (copying) of call targets by implementing cloneUninitialized().  Process.pid is now cached per process like $$.  Fixed repeated deoptimizations for methods building an Array which is growing over multiple calls at a given call site.Bug fixes:  Fixed spawn(..., fd =&amp;gt; fd) on macOS, it did not work due to a macOS bug.  Fixed rb_gc_register_address()/rb_global_variable() to read the latest value (see #2721, #2734).A full list of changes is available in the project changelog.LLVM  Updated the LLVM toolchain to version 15.0.6.  Update musl libc to version 1.2.3.  Implemented long double (128 bit floating point) on the Linux AArch64 architecture.WebAssembly  Added experimental debugging for DWARFv4. This enables debugging of C, C++, and Rust applications.  Added experimental support for Memory64. The feature can be enabled with the option --wasm.Memory64=true.  Implemented the Bulk-Memory and Reference-Types proposal. They can be disabled with the option --wasm.BulkMemoryAndRefTypes.",

Updated the OpenJDK release on which GraalVM Community Edition is built to 20.0.2+9. See the OpenJDK 20 Updates.  Graal compiler: Updated counted strip mining optimization to do not strip mine overflowing loops.  Native Image: Fixed jvmstat performance data initialization.  Native Image: Fixed JDK Flight Recorder (JFR) events constant pool IDs.  Native Image: Fixed user experience issues in Native Image.  Native Image: Fixed analysis results in build reports.GraalVM for JDK 20.0.1(2023-06-13)  Platform Updates  Java and Compiler Updates  Native Image  JavaScript and Node.js  Polyglot Embedding  Truffle Language and Tool Implementations  Java on Truffle  Python  Ruby  LLVM  WebAssemblyPlatform Updates  Released GraalVM Community Edition for JDK 20 based on OpenJDK 20.0.1+8. See OpenJDK 20 Updates.  Simplified the GraalVM package naming: it is graalvm-community-jdk-&amp;lt;full java version&amp;gt;_&amp;lt;platform&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;arch&amp;gt;, for example: graalvm-community-jdk-20.0.1_macos-aarch64_bin.tar.gz.Java and Compiler Updates  Added support for the ZGC garbage collector for workloads that require low latency or use a very large heap size. See #2149.  Strengthened the optimistic aliasing analysis by adding a non-speculative mode. (Improves loop vectorization.) Some code shapes were previously only vectorized in JIT, but not in ahead-of-time compilations. With the improved loop vectorization for Native Image, the differences in those code shapes are gone, allowing the compiler to vectorize more loops for faster execution.  Improved logging of the novel optimization compiler phase: unified interface to log and dump (for example, via JSON) optimization decisions. Optimization phases should use OptimizationLog to log transformations. Read more in OptimizationLog.md and Profdiff.md to learn how to compare performed optimizations in hot compilations.  Open-sourced Ideal Graph Visualizer (IGV) to make it easier for third-party compilers and language developers to use and contribute to it. See more here.See more updates in the changelog.Native ImagePackaging and Platform Updates  Native Image is now shipped as part of GraalVM for JDK 20, and no longer needs to be installed via gu install native-image. Read more here.  Native Image now sets build environments on Windows automatically if it can find a Visual Studio installation in a known location. Therefore, running in an x64 Native Tools Command Prompt is no longer a requirement.  Improved dynamic linking of AWT libraries on Linux. Static linking of AWT libraries on Linux has been a constant source of problems. Dynamic linking avoids the pitfalls of static linking at the expense of no longer having standalone binaries, which is a reasonable trade-off as shown by AWT support on Windows. The linker should no longer fail because of “multiple definitions of jvm”, or crash at the linking step for an AWS/Swing application on Linux.  Jipher JCE, a Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) provider implemented on top of OpenSSL 3.0 FIPS, now supports GraalVM Native Image. It is recommended to enable Jipher with Native Image in contexts where only FIPS-allowed algorithms should be used. See the documentation to get started.New Features  Introduced a new feature: building a native executable from a self-contained bundle on demand. The new option --bundle-create=&amp;lt;imagename&amp;gt;.nib creates a &amp;lt;imagename&amp;gt;.nib file (a build bundle) and the launch.output directory alongside a native executable. The bundle file, &amp;lt;imagename&amp;gt;.nib, is a regular JAR file that contains all information required to build a native executable (or a native shared library). In contrast to regular native-image building, this mode of operation takes only a single *.nib file as an input. At any time later, if the same version of GraalVM is used, the executable can be rebuilt with:    native-image --bundle-apply=.../path/to/launch.nib    It will rebuild the native executable with the same image arguments, environment variables, system properties, classpath, and module-path options as in the initial build. It is a safe and reliable solution to encapsulate all the input required for building into a single file. Learn more in the Native Image Bundles reference manual.    Improved the memory footprint of the Native Image build process. The builder now takes available memory into account to reduce memory pressure when many other processes are running on the same machine. It also consumes less memory in many cases and is therefore also less likely to fail due to out-of-memory errors. At the same time, the memory limit was raised from 14GB to 32GB.  Native Image now targets x86-64-v3 architecture by default on AMD64 and provides a new -march option to specify target compatibility. Use -march=compatibility for best compatibility or -march=native for best performance if a native executable is deployed on the same machine or on a machine with the same CPU features. To list all available machine types, use -march=list.  Improved reporting of missing metadata in Native Image by throwing special exceptions. Native Image does not distinguish between missing reachability metadata and exceptions that were thrown by the Reflection API. For example, the ClassNotFoundException that is thrown when a class is not on the classpath, or when the metadata for a class is not present. Now Native Image users can catch metadata exceptions and debug their programs using the option -XX:ExitOnMissingMetadata to guarantee that all metadata entries are correct. Read more here. This is an experimental feature and is not on by default.  Introduced safe composition of Reflection and Resources metadata in Native Image. For example, reflective methods such as java.lang.Class#getDeclaredMethodsreturn are based on the reachability of other reflective elements. Adding new metadata makes more elements reachable and can change the program functionality. Thanks to the safe composition of metadata optimization, the native-image builder now ensures that every reflective call on java.lang.Class requires a metadata entry. Read more here.  Disallowed the --initialize-at-build-time option without arguments. As a temporary workaround, the -H:+AllowDeprecatedInitializeAllClassesAtBuildTime option turns this error into a warning.  Added an experimental RISC-V mode for Native Image through the LLVM backend. Read more in this blog post.  Improved Profile-Guided Optimizations (PGO) in Native Image (PGO is not available in GraalVM Community Edition):          Profile-guided optimizations now have a new sampling profiler that collect call stacks periodically. Use the option --pgo-sampling to turn on the sampling profiler and collect call stacks. This data is then included in the .iprof file.

Added the option -XX:HeapDumpPath to control where a heap dumps is created.  Added more JFR events for application monitoring: ExecutionSample, ObjectAllocationInNewTLAB, and JavaMonitorInflate.  Improved debugging on Windows: debug information now includes information about Java types. (In collaboration with Red Hat.)  Added experimental support for JMX in Native Image. For example. use --enable-monitoring=jmxclient,jmxserver to include both the JMX client and server in your executables. Read more here. (Together with Red Hat.)  Enabled the JFR event streaming for Native Image. The feature is experimental.

It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (--js.ecmascript-version=staging).      Find more updates in the project changelog.Polyglot Embedding  This is the first release that supports running untrusted applications in a code sandbox. The sandbox policy Context.Builder#sandbox(SandboxPolicy) with four different levels of sandboxing, ISOLATED, UNTRUSTED, TRUSTED, and CONSTRAINED, was implemented to enable users to establish a security boundary between a host application and guest code. The policy is set by passing it to the Engine.Builder#sandbox(SandboxPolicy) or Context.Builder#sandbox(SandboxPolicy) builder method. A host code can execute untrusted guest code using, for example, the UNTRUSTED policy. Host code can also execute multiple mutually distrusting instances of guest code that will be protected from one another. Learn more in the polyglot sandboxing guide. Code sandboxing is currently only supported for Javascript. The SandboxPolicy.ISOLATED and SandboxPolicy.UNTRUSTED policies are not available in GraalVM Community Edition.  Related to the code sandbox implementation, a new option TraceLimits was added to measure a guest application’s resource consumption and obtain realistic sandbox parameters.  Added the IOAccess API: the IO access configuration of a polyglot context. The IO access configuration determines how a guest language can access the host IO. The new IOAccess class provides a predefined configuration to disable host IO access, or to enable full host IO access. A custom configuration can be created using an IOAccess builder.  Added java.lang.BigInteger to the Polyglot Value API. By default, all host values of the type java.lang.BigInteger are now interpreted as number values (Value.isNumber()), unlike before. In order to restore the old behavior, set HostAccess.Builder.allowBigIntegerNumberAccess(boolean) to false. Note that the language support for interpreting numbers that do not fit into long values may vary. Some languages, such as JavaScript, may require explicit conversions of host big integers. Other languages, such as Ruby or Python, can use big integers without explicit conversion. The same applies to values passed across guest languages. See #2737.  Added automatic copying of language resources for embedding Truffle languages in Native Image. The documentation is available here.A full list of changes is available in the changelog.Truffle Language and Tool Implementations  Implemented several new features for Truffle DSL to improve performance.

Improved Truffle DSL node memory footprint by merging generated fields for state and excluding bit sets and improving specialization data class generation to consider activation probability. Specializations should be ordered by activation probability for optimal results.  Improved memory footprint by automatically inlining cached parameter values of enum types into the state bitset.  Truffle DSL now emits many more warnings for recommendations. For example, it emits warnings for inlining opportunities, cached sharing or when a cache initializer should be designated as @NeverDefault. To ease migration work, new ways to suppress the warnings temporarily for a Java package were added. For a list of possible warnings and further usage instructions, see the documentation.  Unclosed polyglot engines are no longer closed automatically on VM shutdown. They die with the VM. As a result, TruffleInstrument#onDispose is not called for active instruments on unclosed engines in the event of VM shutdown. In case an instrument is supposed to do some specific action before its disposal, for example, print some kind of summary, it should be done in TruffleInstrument#onFinalize.  Implemented the policies to control the restriction of code sandboxing. By default, languages and instruments support just the TRUSTED sandbox policy.          If a language wants to target a more restrictive sandbox policy, it must:                  Specify the most strict sandbox policy it satisfies using TruffleLanguage.Registration#sandbox().          For each option, the language must specify the most restrictive sandbox policy in which the option can be used via Option#sandbox(). By default, options have a TRUSTED sandbox policy.          If a language needs additional validation, it can use TruffleLanguage.Env#getSandboxPolicy() to obtain the current context sandbox policy.                    If an instrument wants to target a more restrictive sandbox policy, it must:                  Specify the most strict sandbox policy it satisfies using TruffleInstrument.Registration#sandbox().          For each option, the instrument must specify the most restrictive sandbox policy in which the option can be used via Option#sandbox(). By default, options have a TRUSTED sandbox policy.          If an instrument needs additional validation, it can use TruffleInstrument.Env#getSandboxPolicy() to obtain the engine’s sandbox policy.                    Find many more updates in the Truffle changelog.Java on Truffle (Espresso)New features:  The Truffle InteropLibrary has/getMetaParents API is now fully implemented.  Enabled foreign Instant, TimeZone, Time, Date, Duration when calling espresso via interop.Improvements:  Enabled calling overloaded and Varargs methods through interop.  Improved interoperability with foreign exceptions. A stack trace is now available and type mapping can be used to explicitly map exceptions.PythonPerformance Improvements:  Added a new implementation of the Python C API interface that uses fully native execution by default. This improves performance and compatibility with some extensions that spend a lot of time in native code (such as SciPy, PyTorch, …) but can have negative effects on workloads that frequently cross the Python/native boundary. There are new options to control how extensions are built and run: python.NativeModules and python.UseSystemToolchain. The new default is to use the host system’s toolchain for building extensions rather than the LLVM toolchain that ships with GraalVM and to run all modules natively. A new launcher (graalpy-lt) is available to get the old behavior, which can be useful for debugging.  The performance numbers we report on the website are now based on results from the community’s pyperformance benchmark suite, measuring GraalPy geomean speedup over CPython and Jython. This makes it easier to compare and reproduce our results.Platform Updates:  Implemented building and running basic GraalPy workloads on Windows. This enables Windows users to build and use GraalPy, especially for embedding into Java.  Added GraalPy plugin for Virtualenv as a builtin module, so that creating virtual environments with virtualenv on GraalPy works out of the box.  Updated the builtin venv module to create virtual environments with symlinks instead of generated shell scripts that are delegated to the base GraalPy.Compatibility Improvements:  Updated language version and the standard library to 3.10.8, making it compatible with more recent modules and packages.  Updated the distribution layout of GraalPy to match CPython’s. This reduces the number of patches needed for various build systems to discover GraalPy’s library locations.  Updated numpy and pandas versions.  Implemented scipy and scikit_learn with ginstall.A full list of updates can be found in the project changelog.RubyNew features:  Updated to Ruby 3.1.3.  Foreign big integers are now supported and work with all Numeric operators.Performance:  Made the system libyaml for psych to be used which improves warmup when parsing YAML. This means libyaml is now a dependency. See how to install LibYAML.  Marking of native structures wrapped in objects is now done on the C call exit to reduce memory overhead.  Optimized splitting (copying) of call targets by implementing cloneUninitialized().  Process.pid is now cached per process like $$.  Fixed repeated deoptimizations for methods building an Array which is growing over multiple calls at a given call site.Bug fixes:  Fixed spawn(..., fd =&amp;gt; fd) on macOS, it did not work due to a macOS bug.  Fixed rb_gc_register_address()/rb_global_variable() to read the latest value (see #2721, #2734).A full list of changes is available in the project changelog.LLVM  Updated the LLVM toolchain to version 15.0.6.  Update musl libc to version 1.2.3.  Implemented long double (128 bit floating point) on the Linux AArch64 architecture.WebAssembly  Added experimental debugging for DWARFv4. This enables debugging of C, C++, and Rust applications.  Added experimental support for Memory64. The feature can be enabled with the option --wasm.Memory64=true.  Implemented the Bulk-Memory and Reference-Types proposal. They can be disabled with the option --wasm.BulkMemoryAndRefTypes.",

Fixed a transient guarantee failure in PointsToAnalysisMethod.getContextInsensitiveVirtualInvoke.      Improved the JFR support: switched to PlatformThreads.getCurrentThreadOrNull() instead of Thread.currentThread(); fixed race condition in JVM.commit(long).      Ensured DeoptTargets are generated for methods requiring FrameInformation.      Now the Native Image builder uses synchronized data structures for reachability handlers registration.

GraalVM for JDK 21(2023-09-19)  Platform and Distributions  Removed Functionality  Java and Compiler  Native Image  Polyglot Embedding  JavaScript and Node.js  Java on Truffle  Python  Ruby  WebAssembly  LLVM  Truffle Language and Tool ImplementationsPlatform and Distributions  Released GraalVM Community Edition for JDK 21 based on OpenJDK 21. See OpenJDK 21 Updates.  Released Oracle GraalVM for JDK 21 based on Oracle JDK 21. See Java SE 21 Release Notes.  Released language runtimes as standalone distributions, therefore there are no language launchers in the GraalVM JDK.Two standalone language runtime options are available for both Oracle GraalVM and GraalVM Community Edition: a Native Image compiled native launcher or a JVM-based runtime (included).To distinguish between the GraalVM editions, the GraalVM Community Edition version has the suffix -community in the name, for example:  graaljs-community-&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;os&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;arch&amp;gt;.tar.gz.To distinguish between the runtime mode, a JVM standalone type has the -jvm suffix in a name.Standalone distributions are available on GitHub, in corresponding language repositories. Learn more here.Removed Functionality  Removed GraalVM Updater, gu, used to extend GraalVM installations with GraalVM language runtimes and other components by modifying the installation directory. As part of the alignment with OpenJDK, modifying JDK installations is not common.To continue using the GraalVM language runtime(s) and other components, use language standalones or specify them as Maven or Gradle dependencies in your project. For more information, see Polyglot Embedding updates and the GitHub issue #6855.  Removed the option --language:&amp;lt;language&amp;gt; (to enable a specific language runtime at build time) and some macro options. See below for more details.Java and Compiler  Implemented initial optimization of Java Vector API (JEP 338) operations. Load, store, basic arithmetic, reduce, compare, and blend operations are transformed to efficient machine instructions where possible. It is enabled by default and can be disabled with -Dgraal.OptimizeVectorAPI=false.This optimization is not available in GraalVM Community Edition and not yet available in GraalVM Native Image.Coverage of more operations and Native Image support are planned for the future. This optimization is experimental.  Implemented all intrinsics prior to JDK 21 on both AMD64 and AArch64 architectures for the Graal compiler. We have also ported various HotSpot assembly stubs into Java, including all of the SHA message digest stubs and part of the BigInteger arithmetic computation stubs. This allows Native Image to benefit from these high performance assembly codes.  Users can enable backward-edge CFI in the Graal compiler by setting the -XX:UseBranchProtectionHotSpot option.Whether the user provides standard or PAC-RET protection, the Graal compiler will automatically enable backward-edge CFI when running on the AArch64 architecture.Before a function returns, the Graal compiler issues an authentication instruction that checks the integrity of the signed return address. If this integrity check fails, the authentication instruction stamps the higher bits of the corrupted address reserved for the pointer authentication code (PAC) to invalidate the pointer. When the function returns to the corrupted pointer, then the OS will raise a SIGSEGV signal, since the corrupted pointer now refers to an invalid (for example, unmapped) address. Even if an adversary has full control over the stored return address, the authentication instruction takes away control by resetting whatever the adversary provides to a random point high up in the process address space.Learn more about UseBranchProtection here.  The following JDK 21 features are not available:          JEP 439 Generational ZGC      Native ImageNew Features  Users can now use G1 Garbage Collector on the Linux AArch64 architecture to build efficient native executables with large heaps and minimal pause times (not available in GraalVM Community Edition).Previously, it was only available for Linux AMD64. To enable it, pass the option --gc=G1 to the native-image builder.Learn more about Memory Management in Native Image.  Introduced a new class initialization approach that will become the default in the future: all classes are now allowed to be used and initialized at build time, regardless of the class initialization configuration. For classes that are configured as --initialize-at-run-time this means that they will appear as uninitialized again at run time. To enable the new approach, pass the --strict-image-heap flag to Native Image. For more information and implementation details, take a look at the proposal #4684. Note that there is a known issue when a build that does not satisfy the new policy would fail with the following error: Boolean option value can be only + or -. This will be resolved in a patch release on October 24, 2023 and we will share more details on the new policy and best practices in the upcoming blog post.  Improved the reporting of missing metadata by throwing MissingReflectionRegistrationError when attempting to create a Proxy class without having it registered at build time, instead of VMError.  Added optimization level 3 to the native-image builder for the best peak performance (not available in GraalVM Community Edition).This new level includes optimizations that previously were part of optimization level 2 and that work best together with Profile-Guided Optimizations.As a result, the compilation time when building with the default -O2 is significantly reduced.Also, the --pgo option automatically enables -O3.  Added experimental support for foreign down calls (OpenJDK project Panama) in Native Image. Please test it and provide feedback. Support for upcalls is planned for the future.      Added the option --parallelism to control how many threads are used by the Native Image build process. The minimal number is 2. This option is useful for build environments with constrained resources. Also, starting from this release, the build output will print out the memory and thread limits of the build process, for example:      Build resources:  - 13.24GB of memory (42.7% of 31.00GB system memory, determined at start)  - 16 thread(s) (100.0% of 16 available processor(s), determined at start)    Added the option --color[=WHEN] to color the build output. Replace WHEN with always, never, or auto. This API option supersedes the experimental option -H:+BuildOutputColorful.  Introduced a new option -H:±UnlockExperimentalVMOptions to explicitly unlock access to experimental options, the majority of hosted options (starting with -H:), in Native Image.If access is not explicitly requested, an attempt to use any experimental option will fail the build with an actionable error message in this release. Also, to help users understand which dependencies requested these options, active experimental options will be listed as part of the build output alongside their origin. In the next release, this warning will be turned into a build failure.Meanwhile, the community is encouraged to open issues if certain experimental options should be promoted to public API and marked as stable.For more information, see GitHub issue #7105.  The following JDK 21 features are not available:          JEP 439 Generational ZGC      JEP 442 Foreign Function &amp;amp; Memory API (Third Preview)      JEP 448 Vector API (Sixth Incubator)      Debugging and Monitoring Improvements  Improved the monitoring experience: added support for the Java Flight Recording ThreadCPULoad event. (Together with BellSoft.)  Added support for -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError. (Together with Red Hat.)See a complete list of updates in the changelog.Refactoring GraalVM SDKThe GraalVM SDK is split into four fine-grained modules.The use of the graalvm-sdk module is now deprecated.Note that all GraalVM APIs remain compatible in this release.The following new modules are available:  org.graalvm.nativeimage: The public API of Native Image for advanced use cases.  org.graalvm.polyglot: A library that allows to embed polyglot language implementations in Java.  org.graalvm.word: A low-level library for machine-word-sized values in Java.  org.graalvm.collections: A collections library for GraalVM components.Update your Maven and module dependencies accordingly.If you previously used the GraalVM SDK for Native Image via:&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.sdk&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;graal-sdk&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;23.1.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;Now you use:&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.sdk&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;nativeimage&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;23.1.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;Polyglot embedders can now use:&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.polyglot&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;polyglot&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;23.1.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;For more details, see Polyglot Embedding updates.Find a complete list of updates in the GraalVM SDK changelog.Polyglot Embedding  Turned all GraalVM languages artifacts into standard Maven dependencies for polyglot embedders (see #6852).Previously, to use a GraalVM language in embeddings, you had to install it using the GraalVM Updater tool (e.g., gu install python). To enable a language now, language artifacts now need to be on the Java module or class path.  The use of the graalvm-sdk module is now deprecated; use the org.graalvm.polyglot:polyglot artifact instead.The org.graalvm.polyglot module is no longer contained by default in the GraalVM JDK. To enable a language embedding in Java, specify the language as a dependency. If you need the Truffle tools for your polyglot application, enable them through a dependency too.Below is an example of the Maven configuration:      &amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.polyglot&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;polyglot&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;23.1.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.polyglot&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;!-- Select the language --&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;js|python|ruby|wasm|llvm|java&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;       &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;23.1.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;pom&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.polyglot&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;tools&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;23.1.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;pom&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;    These dependencies use the language and tools built on top of Oracle GraalVM.  To use the GraalVM Community Edition version, add the suffix -community to artifactId, for example, js-community. Please refer to the updated Embedding Languages documentation for further details.        Removed the option --language:&amp;lt;language&amp;gt; (to enable a specific language runtime at build time) and some macro options, namely:      --macro:polyglot-launcher  --macro:polyglot-library  --macro:truffle  --macro:truffle-language-library    They are no longer needed as putting them on the class/module-path does everything necessary.  More updates can be found in the changelog.JavaScript and Node.js  Released the JavaScript (GraalJS) and Node.js runtimes as standalone distributions. Two standalone language runtime options are available for both Oracle GraalVM and GraalVM Community Edition: a Native Image compiled native launcher or a JVM-based runtime (included).To distinguish between them, the GraalVM Community Edition version has the suffix -community in the name: graaljs-community-&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;os&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;arch&amp;gt;.tar.gz., graalnodejs-community-&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;os&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;arch&amp;gt;.tar.gz., A standalone that comes with a JVM has a -jvm suffix in a name.Standalone distributions are available on GitHub.  The ScriptEngine implementation for running JavaScript is no longer shipped with GraalVM. Migrate your setup to explicitly depend on the ScriptEngine module and add it to the module path. See ScriptEngine documentation for details.  To enable the JavaScript runtime, you no longer install it with gu install js (since GraalVM Updater is removed), but add it as a Maven dependency (see below), or explicitly put the JAR on the module path. The Maven dependency for embedding JavaScript into Java were also updated. Below is the Maven configuration for a JavaScript embedding:      &amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.polyglot&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;polyglot&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;23.1.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.polyglot&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;js&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;23.1.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;pom&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;    It enables the Oracle GraalVM JavaScript runtime.  To use a community-licensed version instead, add the -community suffix to each artifact (e.g., js-community). See the dependency setup for language embeddings.    Enabled ECMAScript 2023 features by default.  Implemented new proposals:          Async Context, available behind the experimental option --js.async-context.      String.dedent, available in ECMAScript staging mode behind the --js.ecmascript-version=staging option.        Updated Node.js to version 18.17.1.Find more updates in the project changelog.Java on Truffle  Java on Truffle (Espresso) is no longed shipped with GraalVM, but as a separate standalone distribution and a Maven artifact. Two standalone options are available: Oracle GraalVM and GraalVM Community Edition with a native launcher included.To distinguish between them, the GraalVM Community Edition version has the suffix -community in the name:espresso-community-&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;os&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;arch&amp;gt;.tar.gz.See the Java on Truffle Getting Started.Standalone distributions are available on GitHub.  To enable Java on Truffle, you no longer install it with gu install espresso (since GraalVM Updater is removed), but add it as a Maven dependency (see below), or explicitly put the JAR on the module path.      &amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.polyglot&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;polyglot&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;23.1.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.polyglot&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;java&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;23.1.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;scope&amp;gt;runtime&amp;lt;/scope&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;pom&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;    It enables the Oracle GraalVM Java on Truffle runtime.    Added the option --enable-preview.Find more updates in the project changelog.Python      Released the Python runtime (GraalPy) as a standalone distribution and a Maven artifact (see below). Two standalone language runtime options are available for both Oracle GraalVM and GraalVM Community Edition: a Native Image compiled native launcher or a JVM-based runtime (included).To distinguish between them, the GraalVM Community Edition version has the suffix -community in the name:graalpy-community-&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;os&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;arch&amp;gt;.tar.gz.A standalone that comes with a JVM has the -jvm suffix in a name.See the GraalPy Getting Started.    You can install a GraalPy Community standalone also with pyenv:      # To install GraalPy Community Edition  pyenv install graalpy-community-23.1.0    Standalone distributions are available on GitHub.    To enable GraalVM Python for embedding into Java, add it as a Maven dependency or explicitly put the JAR on the module path. Below is the Maven configuration for a Python embedding:      &amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.polyglot&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;polyglot&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;23.1.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.polyglot&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;python&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;23.1.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;pom&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;    GraalPy is now available for Windows users. GraalPy can be installed on Windows with  venv or pip tools, and supports compilation and execution of C extensions using the native MSVC toolchain.  Improved the GraalPy standalone tool: you can now build single-file executable Python binaries for Linux, Windows, and macOS. The tool can also generate a skeleton Maven project that sets up a polyglot embedding of Python packages into Java.  Added support for the sqlite3 module. This allows many packages like Coverage or Flask-SQLAlchemy to work on top of an embedded database.Find more updates in the project changelog.Ruby  Updated to Ruby 3.2.2.  TruffleRuby standalone for Linux, built on Oracle GraalVM Native Image, now supports the G1 garbage collector which provides significantly better run-time performance.  The TruffleRuby ScriptEngine implementation is removed in favor of the generic ScriptEngine in GraalVM.See a complete list of updates in the project changelog.WebAssembly  Released the GraalVM WebAssembly runtime as a standalone distribution. Two standalone language runtime options are available for both Oracle GraalVM and GraalVM Community Edition: a Native Image compiled native launcher or a JVM-based runtime (included).To distinguish between them, the GraalVM Community Edition version has the suffix -community in the name:wasm-community-&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;os&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;arch&amp;gt;.tar.gz.A standalone that comes with a JVM has the -jvm suffix in a name.See the WebAssembly Getting Started.Standalone distributions are available on GitHub.  Implemented the extended const expressions proposal. The feature can be enabled with the option --wasm.ExtendedConstExpressions=true.  Added the option to enable multiple memories within a Wasm module: --wasm.MultiMemory=true.LLVM  The GraalVM LLVM runtime is no longed shipped with GraalVM, but as a separate standalone distribution. It contains the LLVM toolchain by default. Two standalone language runtime options are available for both Oracle GraalVM and GraalVM Community Edition: a Native Image compiled native launcher or a JVM-based runtime (included).To distinguish between them, the GraalVM Community Edition version has the suffix -community in the name:llvm-community-&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;os&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;arch&amp;gt;.tar.gz.A standalone that comes with a JVM has the -jvm suffix in a name.See the LLVM Getting Started.Standalone distributions are available on GitHub.  Updated LLVM toolchain to version 16.0.1.  Added the flang toolchain wrapper to enable Fortran compilation with embedded bitcode.Truffle Language and Tool Implementations  Truffle language and tools implementations are isolated from the embedder using the Java module-based isolation. This means that they were migrated to Java modules to prevent accidental use of internal APIs.See the details of Truffle languages and instruments required modularization in this document.  Implemented the Internal Resource API for Truffle languages and instruments to be able to lazily unpack and consume resources from the application module path, necessary for execution. This API replaces the concept of “language homes”.For a language or instrument that requires additional files to execute, it needs to follow these steps:          Bundle the necessary files into a standalone distribution (JAR).      Implement the InternalResource interface for handling the resource file unpacking.      Call the Env#getInternalResource method when a language or instrument needs the bundled resource files. This method ensures that the requested InternalResource is unpacked and provides a directory containing the unpacked files. Since unpacking internal resources can be an expensive operation, the implementation ensures that internal resources are cached.        Truffle languages or instruments are now loaded from the application module path, unlike before when they were provided using -Dtruffle.class.path.append on a GraalVM JDK. The Truffle class path is deprecated and should no longer be used.Languages now need to be capable of running as named modules, so the language needs to be migrated. Languages can still be loaded from the class path, but Truffle internally loads them in its own classloader and module layer, so they are required to become modules.  Improved Ideal Graph Visualizer dumping experience:          IR dumping: folders for Truffle now include the compilation tier to differentiate compilations better. Inlined IR graphs are now additionally dumped in separate folders if dump level is &amp;gt;= 2.      AST dumping: the Truffle AST is now dumped as part of the IR dump folder. The dumped AST tree now shows all inlined ASTs in a single tree. Individual functions can be grouped using the “Cluster nodes” function in IGV (top status bar). Root nodes now display their name. Every AST node now has a property graalIRNode that allows to find the corresponding Graal IR constant if there is one.      Find a complete list of updates in the Truffle changelog.",

Likewise, the compiler packages moved into the jdk.graal.compiler namespace. This renaming was done in preparation for Project Galahad, and to establish the namespace jdk.graal for Graal subprojects. See #7621.  The Graal options now use the jdk.graal. prefix, for example, -Djdk.graal.PrintCompilation=true. The legacy graal. prefix is deprecated but still supported (for example, -Dgraal.PrintCompilation=true).  Added -Djdk.graal.PrintIntrinsics to log the intrinsics used by Graal in the current runtime.Find more updates in the changelog.Native ImageNew Features  Added experimental support for the Foreign Function &amp;amp; Memory API (part of “Project Panama”, JEP 454) on the x64 architecture. The API must be explicitly enabled with -H:+ForeignAPISupport (requires also -H:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions). Currently, it includes support for foreign memory functionality and foreign functions downcalls. Modules that perform “restricted” native operations must be specified using the --enable-native-access option. Check Foreign Function and Memory API in Native Image for a more detailed overview of the FFM API support.  The --strict-image-heap option is now enabled by default, so it can be removed from the argument list. It allows all classes to be used at build time but also requires types of all objects in the heap to be explicitly marked for build-time initialization.  Added support for the NATIVE_IMAGE_OPTIONS environment variable, which allows users and tools to pass additional arguments via the environment. Similar to JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS, the value of the environment variable is prepended to the options supplied to native-image. See GitHub issue #4650.Improvements  Improved the Native Image agent tracking calls mechanism: the agent now tracks calls to ClassLoader.findSystemClass, ObjectInputStream.resolveClass, and Bundles.of, and registers resource bundles as bundle name-locale pairs.  Updated the Lambda class name format in Native Image to CapturingClass$$Lambda/0xstableHash to be consistent with the JDK name format.  Improved intrinsification of method handles. This especially improves the performance of equals and hashCode methods for Java records, which use now intrinsified method handles.  Methods, fields, and constructors of the Java Object class, primitive classes, and array classes are now registered by default for reflection.  Improved reporting missing metadata in Native Image by throwing special exceptions (experimental). The users can catch metadata exceptions early and debug related issues using the -H:ThrowMissingRegistrationErrors=&amp;lt;package-prefix&amp;gt; option (or -H:ThrowMissingRegistrationErrors for all packages).  Improved Native Image to correctly rethrow build-time linkage errors at run time for registered reflection queries. This prevents the same queries return empty results without throwing an exception. See GitHub issue #6691.  System#setSecurityManager now throws a java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException by default, instead of a VM error in cases where it is expected to throw an exception. This prevents from halting program execution. If the property java.security.manager is set to anything, but disallow at program startup, this function will throw java.lang.SecurityException according to the Java specification.Debugging and Monitoring Improvements  Added support for the following JFR events: AllocationRequiringGC, SystemGC, and ThreadAllocationStatistics. See GitHub pull requests #7263 and #7294. (Together with Red Hat.)  Provided the API option for creating thread dumps --enable-monitoring=threaddump. The option -H:±DumpThreadStacksOnSignal is now deprecated and marked for removal.Deprecated and Removed Functionality  The options ParseOnce, ParseOnceJIT, and InlineBeforeAnalysis are deprecated and no longer have any effect.  The legacy build option was removed from native-image-agent.Polyglot Runtime  Removed support for legacy &amp;lt;language-id&amp;gt;.home system property. Only org.graalvm.language.&amp;lt;language-id&amp;gt;.home will be used.Polyglot Embedding  Added the ability to use Value#as(Collection.class) to map guest language arrays, (Value#hasArrayElements()), to the Java Collection interface in order to access the array elements without copying the guest language array. Set GitHub issue #260.  Implemented mapping of interop buffers to byte[] in a host application, which included:          Added Value#readBuffer(long, byte[], int, int) to enable bulk reads of buffers into byte arrays.      Custom implementations of ByteSequence, same as the values returned by ByteSequence.create(byte[]), are now interpreted by guest languages as buffers.      Added the ability to use Value#as(ByteSequence.class) to map guest language byte buffers (Value#hasBufferElements()) to the read-only ByteSequence interface in order to access the bytes without copying the guest language buffer.        Deprecated the FileSystems#allowLanguageHomeAccess() method and introduced FileSystem#allowInternalResourceAccess() as a replacement. To ensure compatibility, both methods now provide support for language homes and internal resources.Find a complete list of updates in the changelog.JavaScript and Node.js  Updated Node.js to version 18.18.2.  Implemented the WebAssembly threads proposal.Implemented the Promise.withResolvers proposal. It is available in the ECMAScript staging mode (enabled with --js.ecmascript-version=staging).  Moved the implementation of Async Iterator Helpers proposal (that was split out from Iterator Helpers proposal) behind the experimental option --js.async-iterator-helpers.  Implemented the Well-Formed Unicode Strings proposal. It is available in the ECMAScript staging mode (enabled with --js.ecmascript-version=staging).  Implemented the JSON.parse source text access proposal. It is available in the ECMAScript staging mode (enabled with --js.ecmascript-version=staging).  The WebAssembly support in Node.js was enabled by default. It can be disabled using the experimental option --js.webassembly=false.  Replaced the --js.import-assertions option with --js.import-attributes because the corresponding Import Attributes proposal migrated from the usage of assertions to the usage of attributes.Java on Truffle (Espresso)  Added support for transparently converting common JDK exception types that flow from a host to an embedded Espresso context.  Added support for foreign BigInteger when calling Espresso via the Interop protocol. It included also the adoption of fitsInBigInteger and asBigInteger Truffle interop messages.Java on Truffle (Espresso)  Added support for transparently converting common JDK exception types that flow from a host to an embedded Espresso context.  Added support for transparently converting host primitive arrays to Espresso primitive arrays.  Added support for foreign BigInteger when calling Espresso via the Interop protocol. It included also the adoption of fitsInBigInteger and asBigInteger Truffle interop messages.  Added support for removeArrayElement interop messages for Espresso List objects.  Added bringing overload-selection to parity with what is supported for calling methods when using a constructor via Interop.  Java on Truffle (Espresso) can now run on a JDK 22 host. Supported guest JDK versions are 8, 11, 17, and 21.PythonNew Features  Switched to using the system toolchain instead of the GraalVM LLVM runtime (Sulong). This reduces the footprint in the default configuration where C extensions are run natively.  Added a new option python.InitialLocale to change the default locale. If not set, then Java’s Locale#getDefault is used.  The multiprocessing module now creates new processes by default, using the spawn method. The formerly default method that uses threads and multiple Truffle contexts can be selected using multiprocessing.set_start_method(&#39;graalpy&#39;).  We now provide a collection of GitHub Actions scripts to build popular native extensions on GraalPy. This enables the Python users to build native applications, in a reproducible way, with the correct dependencies on GitHub, and download artifacts from there. See Scripts to build wheels for GraalPy to get started.  Added the GraalPy integration with jBang. You can try it out with the following command:      jbang hello@oracle/graalpython/release/graal-vm/24.0 &quot;print(&#39;Hello GraalPy!&#39;)&quot;  Compatibility  Updated to Python 3.10.13. It inlines the security and bug fixes from 3.10.8 to 3.10.13.  Improved Windows compatibility: added support for installing packages with native extensions on Windows. Simple packages like ujson or kiwisolver will now work when installed from venv inside a Visual Studio command prompt. This means that users can build native applications on Windows.  Included the GraalPy C API revision in the ABI tag for the Python wheels packaging format. This avoids accidentally using incompatible binaries when using snapshots.  Expanded support for the following modules: llvmlite, pydantic-core, catboost, ray, tensorflow, tensorflow-io, readme-renderer, safetensors, keras, pybind11, protbuf, grpcio, PyO3, cryptography, bcrypt, cramjam, libcst, orjson, rpds_py.Interoperability  Improved the polyglot module by adding the API to redefine Truffle interop messages for external user-defined types. For more details see the Truffle Interoperability Extension API.  Interop null values are now treated as identical, not only equal to Python’s None. This means that when java.type(&quot;java.lang.Object[]&quot;)(1)[0] is None, it will return True.  Enabled the allowHostSocketAccess configuration in embeddings. This means sockets can now be disabled independently of other IO operations.  Foreign BigIntegers are now supported and work with all Numeric operators.Find a complete list of updates in the project changelog.RubyNew Features  C/C++ extensions are now compiled using the system toolchain and executed natively instead of using the GraalVM LLVM runtime (Sulong). This leads to faster startup, no warmup, better compatibility, smaller distribution, and faster installation for C/C++ extensions (#3118).  Added full support for the Ruby 3.2 and Ruby 3.3 syntax by adopting the Prism parser (#3117, #3039).  Added support for pattern matching (#3332, #2683).  Implemented most of Ruby 3.2 features (#3039).Performance  Optimized calls with ruby2_keywords forwarding by deciding it per call site instead of per callee.There were multiple bug fixes and compatibility improvements in this release, which you can find in the TruffleRuby release notes.LLVM  Made ld64.lld the default linker on macOS instead of a system linker. This fixes compatibility problems with the LLVM toolchain wrappers and Xcode 15 on macOS platforms.Truffle Language and Tool Implementations  The Truffle languages and tools implementations are now loaded exclusively using the context class loader if it is set and Truffle is found there. If the context class loader is not set or Truffle is not found, then the system class loader is used instead. Context class loaders that do not delegate to the system class loader are commonly used to implement hot-reload functionality.  Added the --engine.AssertProbes option, which asserts that enter and return are always called in pairs on ProbeNode, and verifies the correct behavior of wrapper nodes. Java asserts need to be turned on for this option to have an effect.  Added a new performance warning to Truffle DSL when mixing shared and non-shared inline nodes/profiles triggers the slow path in inlining support code.  Added the system property -Dtruffle.UseFallbackRuntime=true. This property is preferred over the usage of -Dtruffle.TruffleRuntime=com.oracle.truffle.api.impl.DefaultTruffleRuntime.  Added InteropLibrary#readBuffer(long, byte[], int, int) to enable bulk reads of buffers into byte arrays.  Implemented the onYield() and onResume() instrumentation events in the debugger stepping logic.Find a complete list of updates in the Truffle changelog.",

          "content": "Ideal Graph VisualizerIdeal Graph Visualizer (IGV) is a developer tool to analyze compilation graphs and investigate performance issues.IGV is developed to view and inspect intermediate representation graphs – a language-independent intermediate representation (IR) between the sourcelanguage and the machine code, generated by the compiler. It is essential for any language implementers building on top of GraalVM.The IGV tool is developed to allow GraalVM language implementers to optimize their languages assembled with the Truffle framework. As a development tool it should not be installed to production environments.Prerequisites  GraalVM installed.  The mx tool for the development of GraalVM projects (see below).Get StartedIGV is free to use and has to be built on user’s machine with the mx tool - a command-line tool to build, test, run, update the code, and built artifacts for GraalVM.  Clone the mx repository to your work directory:     git clone https://github.com/graalvm/mx.git    Clone the Graal repository:     git clone https://github.com/oracle/graal.git    Add mx to the PATH environment variable:     export PATH=&quot;/path/to/mx:$PATH&quot;    To check whether the installation was successful, run the command:     mx --version     Launch IGV with mx:     mx -p graal/compiler igv  Dump Graphs Using a Ruby ExampleUsing a host Ruby application that embeds some Java, you will now dump compiler graphs over the network.      Save the following code snippet in a file named Test.rb:     require &#39;json&#39; obj = {   time: Time.now,   msg: &#39;Hello World&#39;,   payload: (1..10).to_a } encoded = JSON.dump(obj) js_obj = Polyglot.eval(&#39;js&#39;, &#39;JSON.parse&#39;).call(encoded) puts js_obj[:time] puts js_obj[:msg] puts js_obj[:payload].join(&#39; &#39;)    Install Ruby from a TruffleRuby standalone using a Ruby manager/installer.Check its version to make sure you are running the TruffleRuby distribution:     ruby --version    Run the application, connecting the process to the running IGV:     ruby --vm.Djdk.graal.Dump=:1 --vm.Djdk.graal.PrintGraph=Network Test.rb  This dumps compiler graphs, in the IGV format, over the network to an IGV process listening on 127.0.0.1:4445. Once the connection is made, you are able to see the graphs in the Outline view. Find, for example, the java.lang.String.char(int) folder and open its After Parsing graph by double-clicking. If the node has sourceNodePosition property, then the Processing window will attempt to display its location and the entire stacktrace.Browse GraphsOnce a specific graph is opened, you can search for nodes by name, ID, or by property=value data, and all matching results will be shown.Another great feature of this tool is the ability to navigate to the original guest language source code.Select a node in the graph and click the Go to Source button in the Stack View window.Graphs navigation is also available from the Context menu, enabled by focusing and right-clicking a specific graph node.The Extract Nodes option re-renders a graph and displays only the selected nodes and their neighbors.If the graph is larger than the screen, manipulate with the Satellite view button in the main toolbar to move the viewport rectangle.For user preference, the graph color scheme is adjustable by editing the Coloring filter, enabled by default in the left sidebar.View Source CodeSource code views can be opened in manual and assisted modes.Once you select a node in the graph view, the Processing view opens.If the IGV knows where the source code for the current frame is, the green Go to Source arrow is enabled.If the IGV does not know where the source is, the line is greyed out and a Looking Glass button appears.Press it and select Locate in Java project to locate the correct project in the dialog.The IGV hides projects which do not contain the required source file.The Source Collections serves to display the standalone roots added by Add root of sources general action.If the source is located using the preferred method (for example, from a Java project), its project can be later managed on the Project tab.That one is initially hidden, but you can display the list of opened projects using Window, then Projects.Dump Graphs from Embedded JavaTo dump the GraalVM compiler graphs from an embedded Java application to IGV, you need to add options to the GraalVM-based process.Depending on the language/VM used, you may need to prefix the options by --vm. See the particular language’s documentation for the details.The main option to add is -Djdk.graal.Dump=:1.This will dump graphs in an IGV readable format to the local file system.To send the dumps directly to the IGV over the network, add -Djdk.graal.PrintGraph=Network when starting a GraalVM instance.Optionally a port can be specified.Then dumps are sent to the IGV from the running GraalVM on localhost.If the IGV does not listen on localhost, check under Options, then Ideal Graph Settings|Accept Data From Network can be checked.If there is not an IGV instance listening on 127.0.0.1, or it cannot be connected to, the dumps will be redirected to the local file system.The file system location is graal_dumps/ under the current working directory of the process and can be changed with the -Djdk.graal.DumpPath option.In case an older GraalVM version is used, you may need to explicitly request that dumps include the nodeSourcePosition property.This is done by adding the -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+DebugNonSafepoints options.Relative Documentation  Implement Your Language  The mx tool",

On application exit, the tool calculates and prints per-line coverage information.Instrument APIThe main starting point for tools is subclassing the TruffleInstrument class.Unsurprisingly, the simple tool code base does exactly this, creating the SimpleCoverageInstrument class.The Registration annotation on the class ensures that the newly created instrument is registered with the Instrument API, i.e., that it will be automatically discovered by the framework.It also provides some metadata about the instrument: ID, name, version, which services the instrument provides, and whether the instrument is internal or not.In order for this annotation to be effective the DSL processor needs to process this class.This is, in the case of Simple Tool, done automatically by having the DSL processor as a dependency in the Maven configuration.Now we will look back at the implementation of the SimpleCoverageInstrument class, namely which methods from TruffleInstrument it overrides.These are onCreate, onDispose, and getOptionDescriptors.The onCreate and onDispose methods are self-explanatory: they are called by the framework when the instrument is created and disposed.We will discuss their implementations later, but first let us discuss the remaining one: getOptionDescriptors.The Truffle language implementation framework comes with its own system for specifying command-line options.These options allow tool users to control the tool either from the command line or when creating polyglot contexts.It is annotation-based, and examples for such options are the ENABLED and PRINT_COVERAGE fields of SimpleCoverageInstrument.Both of these are static final fields of the type OptionKey annotated with Option which, similar to the Registration annotation, provides some metadata for the option.Again, as with the Registration annotation, for the Option annotation to be effective the DSL processor is needed, which generates a subclass of OptionDescriptors (in our case named SimpleCoverageInstrumentOptionDescriptors).An instance of this class should be returned from the getOptionDescriptors method to let the framework know which options the instrument provides.Returning to the onCreate method, as an argument, we receive an instance of the Env class.This object gives a lot of useful information, but for the onCreate method we are primarily interested in the getOptions method, which can be used to read which options are passed to the tool.We use this to check whether the ENABLED option has been set and if so we enable our tool by calling the enable method.Similarly, in the onDispose method we check the options for the state of the PRINT_COVERAGE option, and if it is enabled we call the printResults method which will print our results.What does it mean “to enable a tool?”In general, it means that we tell the framework about the events we are interested in and how we want to react to them. Looking at our enable method, it does the following:  First, it defines SourceSectionFilter.This filter is a declarative definition of the parts of the source code we are interested in.In our example, we care about all nodes that are considered expressions, and we do not care about internal language parts.  Second, we obtain an instance of anInstrumenterclass which is an object allowing us to specify which parts of the system we wish to instrument.  Finally, using the Instrumenter class, we specify a Source Section Listener and an Execution Event Factory which are both described in the next two sections.Source Section ListenerThe Language API provides the notion of a Source which is the source code unit, and a SourceSection which is one continuous part of a Source, e.g., one method, one statement, one expression, and so on. More details can be found in the respective javadoc.The first requirement for Simple Tool is to keep track of loaded source code.The Instrument API provides the LoadSourceSectionListener which, when subclassed and registered with the instrumenter, allows users to react to the runtime loading source sections.This is exactly what we do with the GatherSourceSectionsListener, which is registered in the enable method of the instrument.The implementation of GatherSourceSectionsListener is quite simple: we override the onLoad method to notify the instrument of each loaded source section.The instrument keeps a mapping from each Source to a Coverage object which keeps a set of loaded source sections for each source.Execution Event NodeGuest languages are implemented as Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) interpreters.The language implementers annotate certain nodes with tags, which allows us to select which nodes we are interested in, by using the aforementioned SourceSectionFilter, in a language-agnostic manner.The main power of the Instrument API lies in its ability to insert specialised nodes in the AST which “wrap” the nodes of interest.These nodes are built using the same infrastructure that the language developers use, and are, from the perspective of the runtime, indistinguishable from the language nodes.This means that all of the techniques used to optimize guest languages into such high performing language implementations are available to the tool developers as well.More information about these techniques is available in the language implementation documentation.Suffice it to say that for Simple Tool to meet its second requirement, we need to instrument all expressions with our own node that will notify us when that expression is executed.For this task we use the CoverageNode.It is a subclass of ExecutionEventNode which, as the name implies, is used to instrument events during execution.The ExecutionEventNode offers many methods to override, but we are only interested in onReturnValue.This method is invoked when the “wrapped” node returns a value, i.e., is successfully executed.The implementation is rather simple. We just notify the instrument that the node with this particular SourceSection has been executed, and the instrument updates the Coverage object in its coverage map.The instrument is notified only once per node, as the logic is guarded by the flag.The fact that this flag is annotated with CompilationFinal and that the call to the instrument is preceded by a call to transferToInterpreterAndInvalidate() is a standard technique in Truffle, which ensures that once this instrumentation is no longer needed (i.e., a node has been executed), the instrumentation is removed from further compilations, along with any performance overhead.In order for the framework to know how to instantiate the CoverageNode when it is needed, we need to provide a factory for it.The factory is the CoverageEventFactory, a subclass of ExecutionEventNodeFactory.This class just ensures that each CoverageNode knows the SourceSection it is instrumenting by looking it up in the provided EventContext.Finally, when we are enabling the instrument, we tell the instrumenter to use our factory to “wrap” the nodes selected by our filter.Interaction Between Users and InstrumentsThe third and final requirement Simple Tool has is to actually interact with its user by printing line coverage to standard output.The instrument overriders the onDispose method which is unsurprisingly called when the instrument is being disposed of.In this method we check that the proper option has been set and, if so, calculate and print the coverage as recorded by our map of Coverage objects.This is a simple way of providing useful information to a user, but it is definitely not the only one.A tool could dump its data directly to a file, or run a web endpoint which shows the information, etc.One of the mechanisms that the Instrument API provides users with is registering instruments as services to be looked up by other instruments.If we look at the Registration annotation of our instrument we can see that it provides a services field where we can specify which services the instrument provides to other instruments.These services need to be explicitly registered.This allows a nicer separation of concerns among instruments so that, for example, we could have a “real time coverage” instrument which would use our SimpleCoverageInstrument to provide on-demand coverage information to a user through a REST API, and an “aborts on low coverage” instrument which stops the execution if coverage drops below a threshold, both using the SimpleCoverageInstrument as a service.Note: For reasons of isolation, instrument services are not available to application code, and instrument services can only be used from other instruments or guest languages.Installing a Tool into GraalVMSo far, Simple Tool seems to meet all requirements but the question remains: how do we use it?As mentioned before, Simple Tool is a Maven project.Setting JAVA_HOME to a GraalVM installation and running mvn package produces a target/simpletool-&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;.jar.This is the Simple Tool distribution form.The Truffle framework offers a clear separation between the language/tooling code and the application code.For this reason, putting the JAR on the class path will not result in the framework realizing a new tool is needed.To achieve this we use --vm.Dtruffle.class.path.append=/path/to/simpletool-&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;.jar as is illustrated in a launcher script for our simple tool.This script also shows we can set the CLI options we specified for Simple Tool.This means that if we execute ./simpletool js example.js, we will launch the js launcher of GraalVM, add the tool to the framework class path, and run the included example.js file with Simple Tool enabled, resulting in the following output:==Coverage of /path/to/simpletool/example.js is 59.42%+ var N = 2000;+ var EXPECTED = 17393;

Coverage Instrument: a coverage tool example which was used to build up Simple Tool. It is used as the running example in further text where appropriate.  Debugger Instrument: a sketch on how a debugger can be implemented. Note that the Instrument API already provides a Debugger Instrument that can be used directly.  Statement Profiler: a profiler that is able to profile the execution of statements.Instrumentation Event ListenersThe Instrument API is defined in the com.oracle.truffle.api.instrumentation package.Instrumentation agents can be developed by extending the TruffleInstrument class, and can be attached to a running GraalVM instance using the Instrumenter class.Once attached to a running language runtime, instrumentation agents remain usable as long as the language runtime is not disposed.Instrumentation agents on GraalVM can monitor a variety of VM-level runtime events, including any of the following:  Source code-related events: The agent can be notified every time a new Source or SourceSection element is loaded by the monitored language runtime.  Allocation events: The agent can be notified every time a new object is allocated in the memory space of the monitored language runtime.  Language runtime and thread creation events: The agent can be notified as soon as a new execution context or a new thread for a monitored language runtime is created.  Application execution events: The agent gets notified every time a monitored application executes a specific set of language operations. Examples of such operations include language statements and expressions, thus allowing an instrumentation agent to inspect running applications with very high precision.For each execution event, instrumentation agents can define filtering criteria that will be used by the GraalVM instrumentation runtime to monitor only the relevant execution events.Currently, GraalVM instruments accept one of the following two filter types:  AllocationEventFilter to filter allocation events by allocation type.  SourceSectionFilter to filter source code locations in an application.Filters can be created using the provided builder object. For example, the following builder creates a SourceSectionFilter:SourceSectionFilter.newBuilder()                   .tagIs(StandardTag.StatementTag)                   .mimeTypeIs(&quot;x-application/js&quot;)                   .build()The filter in the example can be used to monitor the execution of all JavaScript statements in a given application.Other filtering options such as line numbers or file extensions can also be provided.Source section filters like the one in the example can use Tags to specify a set of execution events to be monitored. Language-agnostic tags such as statements and expressions are defined in the com.oracle.truffle.api.instrumentation.Tag class, and are supported by all GraalVM languages.In addition to standard tags, GraalVM languages may provide other, language-specific, tags to enable fine-grained profiling of language-specific events.(As an example, the GraalVM JavaScript engine provides JavaScript-specific tags to track the usages of ECMA builtin objects such as Array, Map, or Math.)Monitoring Execution EventsApplication execution events enable very precise and detailed monitoring. GraalVM supports two different types of instrumentation agents to profile such events, namely:  Execution listener: an instrumentation agent that can be notified every time a given runtime event happens. Listeners implement the ExecutionEventListener interface, and cannot associate any state with source code locations.  Execution event node: an instrumentation agent that can be expressed using Truffle Framework AST nodes. Such agents extend the ExecutionEventNode class and have the same capabilities of an execution listener, but can associate state with source code locations.Simple Instrumentation AgentA simple example of a custom instrumentation agent used to perform runtime code coverage can be found in the CoverageExample class.What follows is an overview of the agent, its design, and its capabilities.All instruments extend the TruffleInstrument abstract class and are registered in the GraalVM runtime through the @Registration annotation:@Registration(id = CoverageExample.ID, services = Object.class)public final class CoverageExample extends TruffleInstrument {  @Override  protected void onCreate(final Env env) {  }  /* Other methods omitted... */}Instruments override the onCreate(Env env) method to perform custom operations at instrument loading time.Typically, an instrument would use this method to register itself in the existing GraalVM execution environment.As an example, an instrument using AST nodes can be registered in the following way:@Overrideprotected void onCreate(final Env env) {  SourceSectionFilter.Builder builder = SourceSectionFilter.newBuilder();  SourceSectionFilter filter = builder.tagIs(EXPRESSION).build();  Instrumenter instrumenter = env.getInstrumenter();  instrumenter.attachExecutionEventFactory(filter, new CoverageEventFactory(env));}The instrument connects itself to the running GraalVM using the attachExecutionEventFactory method, providing the following two arguments:  SourceSectionFilter: a source section filter used to inform the GraalVM about specific code sections to be tracked.  ExecutionEventNodeFactory: the Truffle AST factory that provides instrumentation AST nodes to be executed by the agent every time a runtime event (as specified by the source filter) is executed.A basic ExecutionEventNodeFactory that instruments the AST nodes of an application can be implemented in the following way:public ExecutionEventNode create(final EventContext ec) {  return new ExecutionEventNode() {    @Override    public void onReturnValue(VirtualFrame vFrame, Object result) {      /*       * Code to be executed every time a filtered source code       * element is evaluated by the guest language.       */    }  };}Execution event nodes can implement certain callback methods to intercept runtime execution events. Examples include:  onEnter: executed before an AST node corresponding to a filtered source code element (e.g., a language statement or an expression) is evaluated.  onReturnValue: executed after a source code element returns a value.  onReturnExceptional: executed in case the filtered source code element throws an exception.Execution event nodes are created on a per code location basis.Therefore, they can be used to store data specific to a given source code location in the instrumented application.As an example, an instrumentation node can simply keep track of all code locations that have already been visited using a node-local flag.Such a node-local boolean flag can be used to track the execution of AST nodes in the following way:// To keep track of all source code locations executedprivate final Set&amp;lt;SourceSection&amp;gt; coverage = new HashSet&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();public ExecutionEventNode create(final EventContext ec) {  return new ExecutionEventNode() {    // Per-node flag to keep track of execution for this node    @CompilationFinal private boolean visited = false;    @Override    public void onReturnValue(VirtualFrame vFrame, Object result) {      if (!visited) {        CompilerDirectives.transferToInterpreterAndInvalidate();        visited = true;        SourceSection src = ec.getInstrumentedSourceSection();        coverage.add(src);      }    }  };}As the above code shows, an ExecutionEventNode is a valid AST node.This implies that the instrumentation code will be optimized by the GraalVM runtime together with the instrumented application, resulting in minimal instrumentation overhead. Furthermore, this allows instrument developers to use the Truffle framework compiler directives directly from instrumentation nodes.In the example, compiler directives are used to inform the Graal compiler that visited can be considered compilation-final.Each instrumentation node is bound to a specific code location.Such locations can be accessed by the agent using the provided EventContext object. The context object gives instrumentation nodes access to a variety of information about the current AST nodes being executed.Examples of query APIs available to instrumentation agents through EventContext include:  hasTag: to query an instrumented node for a certain node Tag (e.g., to check if a statement node is also a conditional node).  getInstrumentedSourceSection: to access the SourceSection associated with the current node.  getInstrumentedNode: to access the Node corresponding to the current instrumentation event.Fine-grained Expression ProfilingInstrumentation agents can profile even fractional events such as language expressions. To this end, an agent needs to be initialized providing two source section filters:// What source sections are we interested in?SourceSectionFilter sourceSectionFilter = SourceSectionFilter.newBuilder()  .tagIs(JSTags.BinaryOperation.class)  .build();// What generates input data to track?SourceSectionFilter inputGeneratingLocations = SourceSectionFilter.newBuilder()  .tagIs(StandardTags.ExpressionTag.class)  .build();instrumenter.attachExecutionEventFactory(sourceSectionFilter, inputGeneratingLocations, factory);The first source section filter (sourceSectionFilter, in the example) is a normal filter equivalent to other filters described before, and is used to identify the source code locations to be monitored.The second section filter, inputGeneratingLocations, is used by the agent to specify the intermediate values that should be monitored for a certain source section.Intermediate values correspond to all observable values that are involved in the execution of a monitored code element, and are reported to the instrumentation agent by means of the onInputValue callback.As an example, let us assume an agent needs to profile all operand values provided to sum operations (i.e., +) in JavaScript:var a = 3;var b = 4;// the &#39;+&#39; expression is profiledvar c = a + b;By filtering on JavaScript binary expressions, an instrumentation agent would be able to detect the following runtime events for the above code snippet:  onEnter(): for the binary expression at line 3.  onInputValue(): for the first operand of the binary operation at line 3. The value reported by the callback will be 3, that is, the value of the a local variable.  onInputValue(): for the second operand of the binary operation. The value reported by the callback will be 4, that is, the value of the b local variable.  onReturnValue(): for the binary expression. The value provided to the callback will be the value returned by the expression after it has completed its evaluation, that is, the value 7.By extending the source section filters to all possible events, an instrumentation agent will observe something equivalent to the following execution trace (in pseudocode):// First variable declarationonEnter - VariableWrite    onEnter - NumericLiteral    onReturnValue - NumericLiteral  onInputValue - (3)onReturnValue - VariableWrite// Second variable declarationonEnter - VariableWrite    onEnter - NumericLiteral    onReturnValue - NumericLiteral  onInputValue - (4)onReturnValue - VariableWrite// Third variable declarationonEnter - VariableWrite    onEnter - BinaryOperation        onEnter - VariableRead        onReturnValue - VariableRead      onInputValue - (3)        onEnter - VariableRead        onReturnValue - VariableRead      onInputValue - (4)    onReturnValue - BinaryOperation  onInputValue - (7)onReturnValue - VariableWriteThe onInputValue method can be used in combination with source section filters to intercept very fine-grained execution events such as intermediate values used by language expressions.The intermediate values that are accessible to the Instrumentation framework greatly depend on the instrumentation support provided by each language.Moreover, languages may provide additional metadata associated with language-specific Tag classes.Altering the Execution Flow of an ApplicationThe instrumentation capabilities that we have presented so far enable users to observe certain aspects of a running application.In addition to passive monitoring of an application’s behavior, the Instrument API features support for actively altering the behavior of an application at runtime.Such capabilities can be used to write complex instrumentation agents that affect the behavior of a running application to achieve specific runtime semantics.For example, one could alter the semantics of a running application to ensure that certain methods or functions are never executed (e.g., by throwing an exception when they are called).Instrumentation agents with such capabilities can be implemented by leveraging the onUnwind callback in execution event listeners and factories.As an example, let’s consider the following JavaScript code:function inc(x) {  return x + 1}var a = 10var b = a;// Let&#39;s call inc() with normal semanticswhile (a == b &amp;amp;&amp;amp; a &amp;lt; 100000) {  a = inc(a);  b = b + 1;}c = a;// Run inc() and alter it&#39;s return type using the instrumentreturn inc(c)An instrumentation agent that modifies the return value of inc to always be 42 can be implemented using an ExecutionEventListener, in the following way:ExecutionEventListener myListener = new ExecutionEventListener() {  @Override  public void onReturnValue(EventContext context, VirtualFrame frame, Object result) {    String callSrc = context.getInstrumentedSourceSection().getCharacters();    // is this the function call that we want to modify?    if (&quot;inc(c)&quot;.equals(callSrc)) {      CompilerDirectives.transferToInterpreter();      // notify the runtime that we will change the current execution flow      throw context.createUnwind(null);    }  }  @Override  public Object onUnwind(EventContext context, VirtualFrame frame, Object info) {    // just return 42 as the return value for this node    return 42;  }}The event listener can be executed intercepting all function calls, for example using the following instrument:@TruffleInstrument.Registration(id = &quot;UniversalAnswer&quot;, services = UniversalAnswerInstrument.class)public static class UniversalAnswerInstrument extends TruffleInstrument {  @Override  protected void onCreate(Env env) {    env.registerService(this);    env.getInstrumenter().attachListener(SourceSectionFilter.newBuilder().tagIs(CallTag.class).build(), myListener);  }}When enabled, the instrument will execute its onReturnValue callback each time a function call returns.The callback reads the associated source section (using getInstrumentedSourceSection) and looks for a specific source code pattern (the function call inc(c), in this case).As soon as such code pattern is found, the instrument throws a special runtime exception, called UnwindException, that instructs the Instrumentation framework about a change in the current application’s execution flow.The exception is intercepted by the onUnwind callback of the instrumentation agent, which can be used to return any arbitrary value to the original instrumented application.In the example, all calls to inc(c) will return 42 regardless of any application-specific data.A more realistic instrument might access and monitor several aspects of an application, and might not rely on source code locations, but rather on object instances or other application-specific data.",

This should only be used during development.For development purposes it is useful to disable the class path separation and enable having the language implementation on the application class path (for example, for testingthe internals of the language).The Language API JAR on Maven Central exports all API packages in its module-info.Apply the --upgrade-module-path option together with -Dgraalvm.locatorDisabled=true and this JAR to export Language API packages:-Dgraalvm.locatorDisabled=true --module-path=&amp;lt;yourModulePath&amp;gt;:${truffle.dir} --upgrade-module-path=${truffle.dir}/truffle-api.jarA sample POM using --upgrade-module-path to export Language API packages can be found in the Simple Language POM.xml file.  Note: Disabling the locator effectively removes all installed languages from the module path as the locator also creates the class loader for the languages.To still use the builtin languages add them to the module-path by pointing the module-path to all needed language homes (for example, $GRAALVM/languages/js).Other JVM ImplementationsUnlike GraalVM, which includes all the dependencies needed to run a language implemented with Truffle, other JVM implementations need additional JARs to be present on the class path.These are the Language API and GraalVM SDK JARs available from Maven Central.Assuming JAVA_HOME points to a stock JDK installation, and that the current working directory is the simplelanguage directory and the Language API and GraalVM SDK JARs are present in that directory, one can execute SimpleLanguage with the following command:$JAVA_HOME/bin/java     -cp graal-sdk-22.1.0.jar:truffle-api-22.1.0.jar:launcher/target/launcher-22.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:language/target/simplelanguage.jar     com.oracle.truffle.sl.launcher.SLMain language/tests/Add.sl",

Alternatively, you can go right to the completed example.Prepare a Demo Application  Note: A Java version between 17 and 20 is required to execute Gradle (see the Gradle Compatibility Matrix). However, if you want to run your application with Java 21 (or higher), there is a workaround: set JAVA_HOME to a Java version between 17 and 20, and GRAALVM_HOME to GraalVM for JDK 21. See the Native Image Gradle Plugin documentation for more details.PrerequisiteMake sure you have installed a GraalVM JDK.The easiest way to get started is with SDKMAN!.For other installation options, visit the Downloads section.      Create a new Java project with Gradle in your favorite IDE, called “H2Example”, in the org.graalvm.example package.    Rename the default app/ directory to H2Example/, then rename the default filename App.java to H2Example.java and replace its contents with the following:     package org.graalvm.example; import java.sql.Connection; import java.sql.DriverManager; import java.sql.PreparedStatement; import java.sql.ResultSet; import java.sql.SQLException; import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.Comparator; import java.util.HashSet; import java.util.List; import java.util.Set; public class H2Example {     public static final String JDBC_CONNECTION_URL = &quot;jdbc:h2:./data/test&quot;;     public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {         // Cleanup         withConnection(JDBC_CONNECTION_URL, connection -&amp;gt; {             connection.prepareStatement(&quot;DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customers&quot;).execute();             connection.commit();         });         Set&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; customers = Set.of(&quot;Lord Archimonde&quot;, &quot;Arthur&quot;, &quot;Gilbert&quot;, &quot;Grug&quot;);         System.out.println(&quot;=== Inserting the following customers in the database: &quot;);         printCustomers(customers);         // Insert data         withConnection(JDBC_CONNECTION_URL, connection -&amp;gt; {             connection.prepareStatement(&quot;CREATE TABLE customers(id INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT, name VARCHAR)&quot;).execute();             PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(&quot;INSERT INTO customers(name) VALUES (?)&quot;);             for (String customer : customers) {                 statement.setString(1, customer);                 statement.executeUpdate();             }             connection.commit();         });         System.out.println(&quot;&quot;);         System.out.println(&quot;=== Reading customers from the database.&quot;);         System.out.println(&quot;&quot;);         Set&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; savedCustomers = new HashSet&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();         // Read data         withConnection(JDBC_CONNECTION_URL, connection -&amp;gt; {             try (ResultSet resultSet = connection.prepareStatement(&quot;SELECT * FROM customers&quot;).executeQuery()) {                 while (resultSet.next()) {                     savedCustomers.add(resultSet.getObject(2, String.class));                 }             }         });         System.out.println(&quot;=== Customers in the database: &quot;);         printCustomers(savedCustomers);     }     private static void printCustomers(Set&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; customers) {         List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; customerList = new ArrayList&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(customers);         customerList.sort(Comparator.naturalOrder());         int i = 0;         for (String customer : customerList) {             System.out.println((i + 1) + &quot;. &quot; + customer);             i++;         }     }     private static void withConnection(String url, ConnectionCallback callback) throws SQLException {         try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url)) {             connection.setAutoCommit(false);             callback.run(connection);         }     }     private interface ConnectionCallback {         void run(Connection connection) throws SQLException;     } }        Delete the H2Example/src/test/java/ directory (if it exists).    Open the Gradle configuration file build.gradle, and replace its contents with the following:     plugins {     id &#39;application&#39;     // 1. Native Image Gradle plugin     id &#39;org.graalvm.buildtools.native&#39; version &#39;0.10.1&#39; } repositories {     mavenCentral() }     // 2. Application main class application {     mainClass.set(&#39;org.graalvm.example.H2Example&#39;) } dependencies {     // 3. H2 Database dependency     implementation(&quot;com.h2database:h2:2.2.220&quot;) } // 4. Native Image build configuration graalvmNative {     agent {         defaultMode = &quot;standard&quot;     }     binaries {         main {             imageName.set(&#39;h2example&#39;)             buildArgs.add(&quot;-Ob&quot;)         }     } }    1 Enable the Native Image Gradle plugin. The plugin discovers which JAR files it needs to pass to native-image and what the executable main class should be.    2 Specify the application main class explicitly.    3 Add a dependency on the H2 Database, an open source SQL database for Java. The application interacts with this database through the JDBC driver.    4 You can pass parameters to the native-image tool in the graalvmNative plugin configuration. In individual buildArgs you can pass parameters exactly the same way as you do from a command line. The -Ob option to enable quick build mode (recommended during development only) is used as an example. imageName.set() is used to specify the name for the resulting binary. Learn about other configuration options from the plugin’s documentation.    The plugin is not yet available on the Gradle Plugin Portal, so declare an additional plugin repository. Open the settings.gradle file and replace the default content with this:     pluginManagement {     repositories {         mavenCentral()         gradlePluginPortal()     } } rootProject.name = &#39;H2Example&#39; include(&#39;H2Example&#39;)    Note that the pluginManagement {} block must appear before any other statements in the file.    (Optional) Build the application. From the root directory of the repository, run the following command:    ./gradlew run    This generates an “executable” JAR file, one that contains all of the application’s dependencies and also a correctly configured MANIFEST file.  Build a Native Executable Using the GraalVM Reachability Metadata RepositoryThe Native Image Gradle plugin provides support for the GraalVM Reachability Metadata repository. This repository provides GraalVM configuration for libraries which do not support GraalVM Native Image by default. One of these is the H2 Database this application depends on. The support needs to be enabled explicitly.  Open the build.gradle file, and enable the GraalVM Reachability Metadata Repository in the graalvmNative plugin configuration:     metadataRepository {     enabled = true }    The whole configuration block should look like:     graalvmNative {     agent {         defaultMode = &quot;standard&quot;     }     binaries {         main {             imageName.set(&#39;h2example&#39;)             buildArgs.add(&quot;-Ob&quot;)         }     }     metadataRepository {         enabled = true     } }    The plugin automatically downloads the metadata from the repository.    Now build a native executable using the metadata:     ./gradlew nativeRun    This generates a native executable for the platform in the build/native/nativeCompile/ directory, called h2example. The command also runs the application from that native executable.  Using the GraalVM Reachability Metadata Repository enhances the usability of Native Image for Java applications depending on 3rd party libraries.Build a Native Executable with the Tracing AgentThe second way to provide the medatata configuration for native-image is by injecting the Tracing agent (later the agent) at compile time.The agent can run in three modes:  Standard: Collects metadata without conditions. This is recommended if you are building a native executable.  Conditional: Collects metadata with conditions. This is recommended if you are creating conditional metadata for a native shared library intended for further use.  Direct: For advanced users only. This mode allows directly controlling the command line passed to the agent.You can configure the agent by either passing the options on the command line, or in the build.gradle file.See below how to collect metadata with the tracing agent, and build a native executable applying the provided configuration.  Open the build.gradle file and see the agent mode specified in the graalvmNative plugin configuration:     graalvmNative {     agent {         defaultMode = &quot;standard&quot;     }     ... }        If you prefer the command-lime option, it is -Pagent=standard.    Now run your application with the agent, on the JVM. To enable the agent with the Native Image Gradle plugin, pass the -Pagent option to any Gradle tasks that extends JavaForkOptions (for example, test or run):    ./gradlew -Pagent run    The agent captures and records calls to the H2 Database and all the dynamic features encountered during a test run into multiple *-config.json files.        Once the metadata is collected, copy it into the project’s /META-INF/native-image/ directory using the metadataCopy task:     ./gradlew metadataCopy --task run --dir src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image    It is not required but recommended that the output directory is /resources/META-INF/native-image/. The native-image tool picks up metadata from that location automatically. For more information about how to collect metadata for your application automatically, see Collecting Metadata Automatically. Here is the expected files tree after this step:            Build a native executable using configuration collected by the agent:     ./gradlew nativeCompile    The native executable, named h2example, is created in the build/native/nativeCompile directory.        Run the application from the native executable:     ./build/native/nativeCompile/h2example    (Optional) To clean up the project, run ./gradlew clean, and delete the directory META-INF with its contents.SummaryThis guide demonstrated how to build a native executable using the GraalVM Reachability Metadata Repository and with the Tracing agent. The goal was to show the difference, and prove how using the reachability metadata can simplify the work.Note that if your application does not call any dynamic features at run time, enabling the GraalVM Reachability Metadata Repository is needless. Your workflow in that case would just be:./gradlew nativeRunRelated Documentation  Reachability Metadata  Native Image Build Tools  Collect Metadata with the Tracing Agent",

The application interacts with this database through the JDBC driver.    2 Enable the Native Image Maven plugin within a Maven profile, attached to the package phase. (You are going to build a native executable using a Maven profile.) A Maven profile allows you to decide whether to just build a JAR file, or a native executable.  The plugin discovers which JAR files it needs to pass to native-image and what the executable main class should be.    3 You can pass parameters to the underlying native-image build tool using the &amp;lt;buildArgs&amp;gt; section. In individual &amp;lt;buildArg&amp;gt; tags you can pass parameters exactly the same way as you do from a command line. The -Ob option to enable quick build mode (recommended during development only) is used as an example. Learn about other configuration options from the plugin’s documentation.    (Optional) Build the application. From the root directory of the repository, run the following command:    mvn clean package    This generates an “executable” JAR file, one that contains all of the application’s dependencies and also a correctly configured MANIFEST file.  Build a Native Executable Using the GraalVM Reachability Metadata RepositoryThe Native Image Maven plugin provides support for the GraalVM Reachability Metadata repository. This repository provides GraalVM configuration for libraries which do not support GraalVM Native Image by default. One of these is the H2 Database this application depends on. The support needs to be enabled explicitly.  Open pom.xml, and include the following into the &amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt; element of the native profile to enable the GraalVM Reachability Metadata Repository:     &amp;lt;metadataRepository&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;enabled&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/enabled&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/metadataRepository&amp;gt;    The configuration block should resemble this:     &amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;buildArgs&amp;gt;         &amp;lt;buildArg&amp;gt;-Ob&amp;lt;/buildArg&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;/buildArgs&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;metadataRepository&amp;gt;         &amp;lt;enabled&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/enabled&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;/metadataRepository&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;    The plugin automatically downloads the metadata from the repository.    Now build a native executable using the profile (note that the profile name is specified with the -P flag):     mvn package -Pnative    This generates a native executable for the platform in the target/ directory, called h2example.        Run the application from the native executable:     ./target/h2example     The application returns a list of customers stored in the H2 Database.  Build a Native Executable with the Tracing AgentThe second way to provide the medatata configuration for native-image is by injecting the Tracing agent (later the agent) at compile time.The agent is disabled by default, but it can be enabled within your pom.xml file or via the command line.The agent can run in three modes:  Standard: Collects metadata without conditions. This is recommended if you are building a native executable. (Default)  Conditional: Collects metadata with conditions. This is recommended if you are creating conditional metadata for a native shared library intended for further use.  Direct: For advanced users only. This mode allows directly controlling the command line passed to the agent.See below how to collect metadata with the tracing agent, and build a native executable applying the provided configuration.  Enable the agent by adding the following into the &amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt; element of the native profile:     &amp;lt;agent&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;enabled&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/enabled&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/agent&amp;gt;    The configuration block should resemble this:     &amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;agent&amp;gt;         &amp;lt;enabled&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/enabled&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;/agent&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;buildArgs&amp;gt;         &amp;lt;buildArg&amp;gt;-Ob&amp;lt;/buildArg&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;/buildArgs&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;metadataRepository&amp;gt;         &amp;lt;enabled&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/enabled&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;/metadataRepository&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;    Executing your application with the agent is more involved and requires you to configure a separate MOJO execution which allows forking a Java process. In the native Maven profile section, add the exec-maven-plugin plugin:     &amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.codehaus.mojo&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;exec-maven-plugin&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;3.1.1&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;executions&amp;gt;         &amp;lt;execution&amp;gt;             &amp;lt;id&amp;gt;java-agent&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;             &amp;lt;goals&amp;gt;                 &amp;lt;goal&amp;gt;exec&amp;lt;/goal&amp;gt;             &amp;lt;/goals&amp;gt;             &amp;lt;phase&amp;gt;test&amp;lt;/phase&amp;gt;             &amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;                 &amp;lt;executable&amp;gt;java&amp;lt;/executable&amp;gt;                 &amp;lt;workingDirectory&amp;gt;${project.build.directory}&amp;lt;/workingDirectory&amp;gt;                 &amp;lt;arguments&amp;gt;                     &amp;lt;argument&amp;gt;-classpath&amp;lt;/argument&amp;gt;                     &amp;lt;classpath/&amp;gt;                     &amp;lt;argument&amp;gt;${mainClass}&amp;lt;/argument&amp;gt;                 &amp;lt;/arguments&amp;gt;             &amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;         &amp;lt;/execution&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;/executions&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/plugin&amp;gt;    Run your application with the agent enabled, on the JVM:     mvn -Pnative -Dagent=true -DskipTests -DskipNativeBuild=true package exec:exec@java-agent    The agent captures and records calls to the H2 Database and all the dynamic features encountered during a test run into multiple *-config.json files in the target/native/agent-output/main/ directory.    Build a native executable using configuration collected by the agent:     mvn -Pnative -Dagent=true -DskipTests package exec:exec@native    It generates a native executable for the platform in the target/ directory, called h2example.    Run the application from the native executable:     ./target/h2example     (Optional) To clean up the project, run mvn clean, and delete the directory META-INF/ with its contents.SummaryThis guide demonstrated how to build a native executable using the GraalVM Reachability Metadata Repository and with the Tracing agent. The goal was to show the difference, and prove how using the reachability metadata can simplify the work.Note that if your application does not call any dynamic features at run time, enabling the GraalVM Reachability Metadata Repository is needless. Your workflow in that case would just be:mvn package -PnativeRelated Documentation  Reachability Metadata  Collect Metadata with the Tracing Agent  Native Image Build Tools",

          "content": "GraalVM OverviewGraalVM compiles your Java applications ahead of time into standalone binaries. These binaries are smaller, start up to 100x faster, provide peak performance with no warmup, and use less memory and CPU than applications running on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).GraalVM reduces the attack surface of your application. It excludes unused classes, methods, and fields from the application binary.It restricts reflection and other dynamic Java language features to build time only. It does not load any unknown code at run time.Popular microservices frameworks such as Spring Boot, Micronaut, Helidon, and Quarkus, and cloud platforms such as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure all support GraalVM.With profile-guided optimization and the G1 (Garbage-First) garbage collector, you can get lower latency and on-par or better peak performance and throughput compared to applications running on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).You can use the GraalVM JDK just like any other Java Development Kit in your IDE.Licensing and SupportOracle GraalVM is licensed under GraalVM Free Terms and Conditions (GFTC) including License for Early Adopter Versions.Subject to the conditions in the license, including the License for Early Adopter Versions, the GFTC is intended to permit use by any user including commercial and production use. Redistribution is permitted as long as it is not for a fee.Oracle GraalVM is also free to use on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.For more information about Oracle GraalVM licensing, see the Oracle Java SE Licensing FAQ.GraalVM Community Edition is open-source software built from the sources available on GitHub and distributed under version 2 of the GNU General Public License with the “Classpath” Exception, which are the same terms as for Java.Check the licenses of individual GraalVM components which are generally derivative of the license of a particular language and may differ.What to Read NextStart with installing GraalVM by following the installation guide.Whether you are new to GraalVM Native Image or have little experience using it, continue to Getting Started.After that we suggest you to take look at User Guides.Developers who have experience using GraalVM and Native Image can proceed to the Reference Manuals for in-depth coverage.To start coding with GraalVM APIs, check the GraalVM SDK Java API Reference.If you cannot find the answer you need in the available documentation or have a troubleshooting query, you can ask for help in a Slack channel or submit a GitHub issue.",

          "title": "Migration from JRuby to TruffleRuby",
          "content": "Migration from JRuby to TruffleRubyWhen trying TruffleRuby on your gems and applications, you are encouraged to get in touch with the TruffleRuby team for help.DeploymentIf you are migrating from JRuby, probably the easiest way to use TruffleRuby is to install the TruffleRuby JVM Standalone.If you do not need the Java interoperability capabilities of TruffleRuby, then you can install the TruffleRuby Native Standalone.Using Ruby from JavaJRuby supports many different ways to embed Ruby in Java, including JSR 223 (also know as javax.script), the Bean Scripting Framework (BSF), JRuby Embed (also known as Red Bridge), and the JRuby direct embedding API.The best way to embed TruffleRuby is to use the Polyglot API.The API is different because it is designed to support many languages, not just Ruby.TruffleRuby also supports JSR 223, compatible with JRuby, to make it easier to run legacy JRuby code.See this documentation for how to use it.You will need to use the JVM standalone or depend on the org.graalvm.polyglot:polyglot Maven package to use the Polyglot API.See the polyglot documentation for more information about how to use Ruby from other languages including Java; this document only shows the comparison to JRuby.Creating a ContextIn JRuby with JSR 223 you would have written:ScriptEngineManager m = new ScriptEngineManager();ScriptEngine scriptEngine = m.getEngineByName(&quot;ruby&quot;);Or with BSF you would have written:BSFManager.registerScriptingEngine(&quot;jruby&quot;, &quot;org.jruby.embed.bsf.JRubyEngine&quot;, null);BSFManager bsfManager = new BSFManager();Or with JRuby Embed you would have written:ScriptingContainer container = new ScriptingContainer();Or with the direct embedding API you would have written:Ruby ruby = Ruby.newInstance(new RubyInstanceConfig());In TruffleRuby you now write:Context polyglot = Context.newBuilder().allowAllAccess(true).build();The allowAllAccess(true) method allows the permissive access privileges that Ruby needs for full functionality.GraalVM by default disallows many privileges which may not be safe, such as native file access, but a normal Ruby installation uses these so we enable them.You can decide not to grant those privileges, but this will restrict some of Ruby’s functionality.// No privileges granted, restricts functionalityContext polyglot = Context.newBuilder().build();You would normally create your context inside a try block to ensure it is properly disposed:try (Context polyglot = Context.newBuilder().allowAllAccess(true).build()) {}See the Context API for detailed documentation about Context.Setting OptionsYou can set TruffleRuby options via system properties, or via the .option(name, value) builder method.Evaluating CodeIn JRuby where you would have written one of these JRuby examples, the options available are given:scriptEngine.eval(&quot;puts &#39;hello&#39;&quot;);bsfManager.exec(&quot;jruby&quot;, &quot;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&quot;, 1, 0, &quot;puts &#39;hello&#39;&quot;);container.runScriptlet(&quot;puts &#39;hello&#39;&quot;);ruby.evalScriptlet(&quot;puts &#39;hello&#39;&quot;);In TruffleRuby you now write this:polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;puts &#39;hello&#39;&quot;);Note that eval supports multiple languages, so you need to specify the language each time.Evaluating Code with ParametersIn JRuby with JSR 223 you can pass parameters, called bindings, into a script:Bindings bindings = scriptEngine.createBindings();bindings.put(&quot;a&quot;, 14);bindings.put(&quot;b&quot;, 2);scriptEngine.eval(&quot;puts a + b&quot;, bindings);In TruffleRuby the eval method does not take parameters. Instead you should return a proc which does take parameters, and then call execute on this value:polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;-&amp;gt; a, b { puts a + b }&quot;).execute(14, 2);Primitive ValuesThe different embedding APIs handle primitive values in different ways.In JSR 223, BSF, and JRuby Embed, the return type is Object and can be cast to a primitive like long and checked with instanceof.In the direct embedding API the return is the root IRubyObject interface and you will need to convert a primitive to an Integer, and from there to a Java long:(long) scriptEngine.eval(&quot;14 + 2&quot;);(long) bsfManager.eval(&quot;jruby&quot;, &quot;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&quot;, 1, 0, &quot;14 + 2&quot;);(long) container.runScriptlet(&quot;14 + 2&quot;);ruby.evalScriptlet(&quot;14 + 2&quot;).convertToInteger().getLongValue();In TruffleRuby the return value is always an encapsulated Value object, which can be accessed as a long if that is possible for the object. fitsInLong() can test this:polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;14 + 2&quot;).asLong();Calling MethodsTo call a method on an object you get from an eval, or any other object, in the JRuby embedding APIs you either need to ask the context to invoke the method, or in the case of direct embedding you need to call a method on the receiver and marshal the arguments into JRuby types yourself.The BSF does not appear to have a way to call methods:((Invocable) scriptEngine).invokeMethod(scriptEngine.eval(&quot;Math&quot;), &quot;sin&quot;, 2);container.callMethod(container.runScriptlet(&quot;Math&quot;), &quot;sin&quot;, 2);ruby.evalScriptlet(&quot;Math&quot;).callMethod(ruby.getCurrentContext(), &quot;sin&quot;, new IRubyObject[]{ruby.newFixnum(2)})In TruffleRuby the Value class has a getMember method to return Ruby methods on an object, which you can then call by calling execute.You do not need to marshal the arguments:polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;Math&quot;).getMember(&quot;sin&quot;).execute(2);To call methods on a primitive, use a lambda:polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;-&amp;gt; x { x.succ }&quot;).execute(2).asInt();Passing BlocksBlocks are a Ruby-specific language feature, so they don’t appear in language agnostic APIs like JSR 223 and BSF.The JRuby Embed API and direct embedding do allow passing a Block parameter to the callMethod method, but it is not clear how you would create a Block object to use this.In TruffleRuby you should return a Ruby lambda that performs your call, passing a block that executes a Java lambda that you pass in:polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;-&amp;gt; block { (1..3).each { |n| block.call n } }&quot;)  .execute(polyglot.asValue((IntConsumer) n -&amp;gt; System.out.println(n)));Creating ObjectsJRuby embedding APIs don’t have support for creating new objects, but you can just call the new method yourself:((Invocable) scriptEngine).invokeMethod(scriptEngine.eval(&quot;Time&quot;), &quot;new&quot;, 2021, 3, 18);container.callMethod(container.runScriptlet(&quot;Time&quot;), &quot;new&quot;, 2021, 3, 18)ruby.evalScriptlet(&quot;Time&quot;).callMethod(ruby.getCurrentContext(), &quot;new&quot;,  new IRubyObject[]{ruby.newFixnum(2021), ruby.newFixnum(3), ruby.newFixnum(8)})In TruffleRuby you can create an object from a Ruby class using newInstance.You can use canInstantiate to see if this will be possible:polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;).newInstance(2021, 3, 18);Handling StringsIn JRuby’s embedding APIs you would use toString to convert to a Java String.Use asString in TruffleRuby (and isString to check).Accessing ArraysJRuby’s arrays implement List&amp;lt;Object&amp;gt;, so you can cast to this interface to access them:((List) scriptEngine.eval(&quot;[3, 4, 5]&quot;)).get(1);((List) container.runScriptlet(&quot;[3, 4, 5]&quot;)).get(1);((List) bsfManager.eval(&quot;jruby&quot;, &quot;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&quot;, 1, 0, &quot;[3, 4, 5]&quot;)).get(1);((List) ruby.evalScriptlet(&quot;[3, 4, 5]&quot;)).get(1);In TruffleRuby you can use getArrayElement, setArrayElement, andgetArraySize, or you can use as(List.class) to get a List&amp;lt;Object&amp;gt;:polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;[3, 4, 5]&quot;).getArrayElement(1);polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;[3, 4, 5]&quot;).as(List.class).get(1);Accessing HashesJRuby’s hashes implement Map&amp;lt;Object, Object&amp;gt;, so you can cast to thisinterface to access them:((Map) scriptEngine.eval(&quot;{&#39;a&#39; =&amp;gt; 3, &#39;b&#39; =&amp;gt; 4, &#39;c&#39; =&amp;gt; 5}&quot;)).get(&quot;b&quot;);((Map) scriptEngine.eval(&quot;{3 =&amp;gt; &#39;a&#39;, 4 =&amp;gt; &#39;b&#39;, 5 =&amp;gt; &#39;c&#39;}&quot;)).get(4);In TruffleRuby there is currently no uniform way to access hashes or dictionary-like data structures.At the moment we recommend using a lambda accessor:Value hash = polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;{&#39;a&#39; =&amp;gt; 3, &#39;b&#39; =&amp;gt; 4, &#39;c&#39; =&amp;gt; 5}&quot;);Value accessor = polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;-&amp;gt; hash, key { hash[key] }&quot;);accessor.execute(hash, &quot;b&quot;);Implementing InterfacesYou may want to implement a Java interface using a Ruby object (example copied from the JRuby wiki):interface FluidForce {  double getFluidForce(double a, double b, double depth);}class EthylAlcoholFluidForce  def getFluidForce(x, y, depth)    area = Math::PI * x * y    49.4 * area * depth  endendEthylAlcoholFluidForce.newString RUBY_SOURCE = &quot;class EthylAlcoholFluidForcen  def getFluidForce...&quot;;In JSR 223 you can use getInterface(object, Interface.class).In JRuby Embed you can use getInstance(object, Interface.class).In direct embedding you can use toJava(Interface.class).BSF does not appear to support implementing interfaces:FluidForce fluidForce = ((Invocable) scriptEngine).getInterface(scriptEngine.eval(RUBY_SOURCE), FluidForce.class);FluidForce fluidForce = container.getInstance(container.runScriptlet(RUBY_SOURCE), FluidForce.class);FluidForce fluidForce = ruby.evalScriptlet(RUBY_SOURCE).toJava(FluidForce.class);fluidForce.getFluidForce(2.0, 3.0, 6.0);In TruffleRuby you can get an interface implemented by your Ruby object by using as(Interface.class):FluidForce fluidForce = polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, RUBY_SOURCE).as(FluidForce.class);fluidForce.getFluidForce(2.0, 3.0, 6.0);JRuby allows the name of the Ruby method to be get_fluid_force, using Ruby conventions, instead of getFluidForce, using Java conventions.TruffleRuby does not support this at the moment.Implementing LambdasAs far as we know, JSR 223, BSF, JRuby Embed, and direct embedding do not have a convenient way to get a Java lambda from a Ruby lambda.In TruffleRuby you can get a Java lambda (really an implementation of a functional interface) from a Ruby lambda by usingas(FunctionalInterface.class):BiFunction&amp;lt;Integer, Integer, Integer&amp;gt; adder = polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;-&amp;gt; a, b { a + b }&quot;).as(BiFunction.class);adder.apply(14, 2).intValue();Parse Once Run Many TimesSome of the JRuby embedding APIs allow a script to be compiled once and then eval’d several times:CompiledScript compiled = ((Compilable) scriptEngine).compile(&quot;puts &#39;hello&#39;&quot;);compiled.eval();In TruffleRuby you can simply return a lambda from parsing and execute this many times.It will be subject to optimization like any other Ruby code:Value parsedOnce = polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;-&amp;gt; { run many times }&quot;);parsedOnce.execute();Using Java from RubyTruffleRuby provides its own scheme for Java interoperability that is consistent for use from any GraalVM language, to any other GraalVM language.This is not compatible with existing JRuby-Java interoperability, so you will need to migrate.Polyglot programming in general is documented elsewhere - this section describes it relative to JRuby.This example is from the JRuby wiki:require &#39;java&#39;# With the &#39;require&#39; above, you now can refer to things that are part of the# standard Java platform via their full paths.frame = javax.swing.JFrame.new(&quot;Window&quot;) # Creating a Java JFramelabel = javax.swing.JLabel.new(&quot;Hello World&quot;)# You can transparently call Java methods on Java objects, just as if they were defined in Ruby.frame.add(label)  # Invoking the Java method &#39;add&#39;.frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(javax.swing.WindowConstants::EXIT_ON_CLOSE)frame.packframe.setVisible(true)sleepIn TruffleRuby we would write that this way instead:Java.import &#39;javax.swing.JFrame&#39;Java.import &#39;javax.swing.JLabel&#39;Java.import &#39;javax.swing.WindowConstants&#39;frame = JFrame.new(&quot;Window&quot;)label = JLabel.new(&quot;Hello World&quot;)frame.add(label)frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(WindowConstants.EXIT_ON_CLOSE)frame.packframe.setVisible(true)sleepInstead of using Ruby metaprogramming to simulate a Java package name, we explicitly import classes.Java.import is similar to JRuby’s java_import, and does ClassName = Java.type(&#39;package.ClassName&#39;).Constants are read by reading properties of the class rather than using Ruby notation.Require JavaDo not require &#39;java&#39; in TruffleRuby. However, you do need to run in --jvm mode.This is not available in the Native Standalone.Referring to ClassesIn JRuby, Java classes can either be referenced in the Java module, such as Java::ComFoo::Bar, or if they have a common TLD they can be referenced as com.foo.Bar. java_import com.foo.Bar will define Bar as a top-level constant.In TruffleRuby, Java classes are referred to using either Java.type(&#39;com.foo.Bar&#39;), which you would then normally assign to a constant, or you can use Java.import &#39;com.foo.Bar&#39; to have Bar defined in the enclosing module.Wildcard Package ImportsJRuby lets you include_package &#39;com.foo&#39; which will make all classes in that package available as constants in the current scope.In TruffleRuby you refer to classes explicitly.Calling Methods and Creating InstancesIn both JRuby and TruffleRuby you call Java methods as you would a Ruby method.JRuby will rewrite method names such as my_method to the Java convention of myMethod, and convert getFoo to foo, and setFoo to foo=.TruffleRuby does not perform these conversions.Calling Overloaded MethodWhen multiple overloads are possible, it needs to be selected explicitly.For instance java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService has both submit(Runnable) and submit(Callable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; task).Calling submit without specifying which one shows the possible overloads:$ ruby -e &#39;Java.type(&quot;java.util.concurrent.Executors&quot;).newFixedThreadPool(1).submit {}&#39;-e:1:in `main&#39;: Multiple applicable overloads found for method name submit (candidates: [  Method[public java.util.concurrent.Future java.util.concurrent.AbstractExecutorService.submit(java.util.concurrent.Callable)],  Method[public java.util.concurrent.Future java.util.concurrent.AbstractExecutorService.submit(java.lang.Runnable)]],  arguments: [RubyProc@4893b344 (RubyProc)]) (TypeError)You can select a specific overload using:executor = Java.type(&quot;java.util.concurrent.Executors&quot;).newFixedThreadPool(1)executor[&#39;submit(java.lang.Runnable)&#39;].call(-&amp;gt; { 1 })# orexecutor.send(&quot;submit(java.lang.Runnable)&quot;) { 1 }Referring to ConstantsIn JRuby, Java constants are modelled as Ruby constants, MyClass::FOO.In TruffleRuby you use the read notation to read them as a property, MyClass.FOO or MyClass[:FOO].Using Classes from JAR filesIn JRuby you can add classes and JARs to the classpath using require.In TruffleRuby at the moment you use the -classpath JVM flag as normal.Additional Java-Specific MethodsJRuby defines these methods on Java objects; use these equivalents instead.java_class - use class.java_kind_of? - use is_a?java_object - not supported.java_send - use __send__.java_method - not supported.java_alias - not supported.Creating Java ArraysIn JRuby you use Java::byte[1024].new.In TruffleRuby you would use Java.type(&#39;byte[]&#39;).new(1024).Implementing Java InterfacesJRuby has several ways to implement an interface.For example, to add an action listener to a Swing button we could do any of the following three things:class ClickAction  include java.awt.event.ActionListener  def actionPerformed(event)   javax.swing.JOptionPane.showMessageDialog nil, &#39;hello&#39;  endendbutton.addActionListener ClickAction.newbutton.addActionListener do |event|  javax.swing.JOptionPane.showMessageDialog nil, &#39;hello&#39;endbutton.addActionListener -&amp;gt; event {  javax.swing.JOptionPane.showMessageDialog nil, &#39;hello&#39;}In TruffleRuby we’d always use the last option to generate an interface:button.addActionListener -&amp;gt; event {  JOptionPane.showMessageDialog nil, &#39;hello&#39;}Generating Java Classes at RuntimeJRuby supports converting a Ruby class to a concrete Java class using become_java!.TruffleRuby does not support this.We recommend using a proper Java interface as your interface between Java and Ruby.Reopening Java ClassesJava classes cannot be reopened in TruffleRuby.Subclassing Java ClassesJava classes cannot be subclassed in TruffleRuby. Use composition or interfaces instead.Extending TruffleRuby Using JavaJRuby supports extensions written in Java. These extensions are written against an informal interface that is simply the entire internals of JRuby, similar to how the MRI C extension interface works.TruffleRuby does not support writing these kind of Java extensions at the moment.We recommend using Java interop as described above.ToolingStandalone Classes and JARsJRuby supports compiling to standalone source classes and compiled JARs from Ruby using jrubyc.TruffleRuby does not support compiling Ruby code to Java. We recommend using the Polyglot API as your entry point from Java to Ruby.WarblerJRuby supports building WAR files for loading into enterprise Java web servers.TruffleRuby does not support this at the moment.VisualVMVisualVM works for TruffleRuby as for JRuby.Additionally, VisualVM understands Ruby objects, rather than Java objects, when you use the heap dump tool.",

ExamplesThe examples assume that you have created a database account with the necessary privileges to create MLE modules and environments, as well as PL/SQL functions, procedures, and packages.The account has also been granted the privilege to execute JavaScript code.(For more information, see MLE Security.)

The above module defines two functions:          string2obj()      obj2Str()        The export keyword at end of the module means that these functions can be called by other MLE modules, PL/SQL, as well as SQL.        The second example shows how to make these functions available in SQL and PL/SQL.Functions within JavaScript modules cannot be called directly in SQL and PL/SQL.Instead, you create a call specification for them.A call specification can be thought of as a “wrapper” in PL/SQL.Depending on your requirements you can either use standalone functions and procedures, or group them in a package.Since these two functions belong to the helper_module they go in a package.     create or replace package helper_pkg as     function string2obj(         p_inputString varchar2     ) return JSON         as mle module helper_module_inline         signature &#39;string2obj&#39;;     function obj2String(         p_inputObject JSON     ) return varchar2         as mle module helper_module_inline         signature &#39;obj2String&#39;; end helper_pkg; /    With the call specification in place you can convert a string, delimited by ; into a JavaScript object and return it to the caller, as follows     select json_serialize(     helper_pkg.string2obj(         &#39;order_id=1;order_date=2023-04-24T10:27:52;order_mode=mail;promotion_id=1&#39;     )     pretty ) string2obj;    You should see the following output:     STRING2OBJ ---------------------------------------- {     &quot;order_id&quot; : &quot;1&quot;,     &quot;order_date&quot; : &quot;2023-04-24T10:27:52&quot;,     &quot;order_mode&quot; : &quot;mail&quot;,     &quot;promotion_id&quot; : &quot;1&quot;         }        Beginning with Oracle Database 23.3 it is possible to provide the JavaScript code in line with the call specification if all you need to do is invoke a standard piece of JavaScript code, as shown below:     create or replace function date_to_epoch(   &quot;ts&quot; timestamp ) return number as mle language javascript ; /    Inline JavaScript procedures have some limitations, e.g. they cannot import other MLE modules (they can, however require the libraries that ship with MLE). This is why you should consider using MLE modules for writing more complex logic and/or making it re-usable within other modules. You can now invoke the date_to_epoch() function directly from SQL as shown in this example:     select   date_to_epoch (     to_timestamp(&#39;2000-01-01 12:00:00&#39;, &#39;yyyy-mm-dd hh24:mi:ss&#39;)   ) seconds_since_epoch /        You can invoke MLE modules from other modules. This is typically the case when CREATING more complex logic, or third-party modules. Load the popular validator.js module into the database as described in Using JavaScript community modules in Oracle Database 23c Free - Developer Release—adhering to the caveats such as license and compliance. Now you can import the ECMASCript (ESM) version of the module from your favorite Content Delivery Network (CDN), as described in the article above.  Assume the validator module is created as validator_module in the database.  You can use the module in your own code as follows:     create or replace mle module validator_usage_demo_module language javascript as import validator from &#39;validator&#39;; export function emailCheck(str) {   return validator.isEMail(str); }    The element that maps the import name (validator) to the module is called an MLE environment. Because there is no file system that MLE can use to resolve import names, you have to explicitly declare the mapping, as follows:     create or replace mle env validator_env imports (   &#39;validator&#39; module validator_module );    The MLE environment helps map import names to modules in call specifications. If you want to expose the SQL function emailCheck(), then create the following call specification:     create or replace function email_check(p_str varchar2) return boolean as mle module validator_usage_demo_module env validator_env signature &#39;emailCheck&#39;; /    Now you can call email_check almost anywhere.  Type ConversionsKnowing how type conversions work is very important—whenever your code “leaves” SQL or PL/SQL, the types must be converted to their analogous JavaScript types.(For more information about Type Conversions, see MLE Type Conversions.)You may know that a JavaScript Number is implemented as a double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value.There might be problems with the maximum number it can store as well as loss of precision.The following examples demonstrate the potential loss of precision.create table demo_table (  id      number constraint pk_demo_table primary key,  value   number not null);insert into demo_table(  id,  value) values  (1, 0.1),  (2, 0.2);create or replace procedure precision_loss(  &quot;id1&quot; demo_table.id%type,  &quot;id2&quot; demo_table.id%type)as mle language javascript;/begin precision_loss(1, 2); end;/The precision_loss() procedure prints a value of 0.30000000000000004 to the console (instead of 0.3).To circumvent the loss of precision you can follow many strategies laid out in Calling PL/SQL and SQL from the MLE JavaScript SQL Driver.One approach is to instruct the SQL driver to return the number as the type OracleNumber: a wrapper type for Oracle’s Number data type in JavaScript:create or replace procedure precision_preserved(  &quot;id1&quot; demo_table.id%type,  &quot;id2&quot; demo_table.id%type)as mle language javascript;/begin precision_preserved(1, 2); end;/The precision_preserved() procedure now prints the correct result (0.3) to the console.Wrapper data types are documented in the mle-js-plsqltypes module.Whenever you require number precision, consider using one of the wrapper data types.Dynamic JavaScript executionOracle Database 21c introduced MLE in form of the DBMS_MLE package.It is still available, however its focus has shifted to framework developers and embedding into REPL (Read Eval Print Loop) systems.APEX, Database Actions and others use the package under the covers.Here is a basic example how to code with DBMS_MLE:set serveroutput on;declare    l_ctx           dbms_mle.context_handle_t;    l_source_code   clob;begin    -- Create execution context for MLE execution    l_ctx    := dbms_mle.create_context();    -- using q-quotes to avoid problems with unwanted string termination    l_source_code :=q&#39;~    const result = session.execute(        `select &#39;hello, world&#39;`,        [],        {            outFormat: oracledb.OUT_FORMAT_ARRAY        }    );    const message = result.rows[0][0];    console.log(message);   ~&#39;;    dbms_mle.eval(        context_handle =&amp;gt; l_ctx,        language_id =&amp;gt; &#39;JAVASCRIPT&#39;,        source =&amp;gt; l_source_code,        source_name =&amp;gt; &#39;example01&#39;    );    dbms_mle.drop_context(l_ctx);exception    when others then        dbms_mle.drop_context(l_ctx);        raise;end;/The anonymous PL/SQL block prints hello, world to the console.If you want to use modules other than those built into MLE, you must use MLE environments.Building on the foundation laid by the previously created validator_env, you can verify an email using DBMS_MLE as follows:set serveroutput on;declare    l_ctx           dbms_mle.context_handle_t;    l_source_code   clob;begin    -- Create execution context for MLE execution and provide an environment    l_ctx    := dbms_mle.create_context(&#39;VALIDATOR_ENV&#39;);    -- using q-quotes to avoid problems with unwanted string termination    l_source_code :=q&#39;~(async() =&amp;gt; {  const { default: validator } = await import (&#39;validator&#39;);  const str = &#39;not an email address&#39;;  console.log(`Is ${str} a valid email address? ${validator.isEmail(str)}`);})()   ~&#39;;    dbms_mle.eval(        context_handle =&amp;gt; l_ctx,        language_id =&amp;gt; &#39;JAVASCRIPT&#39;,        source =&amp;gt; l_source_code,        source_name =&amp;gt; &#39;example02&#39;    );    dbms_mle.drop_context(l_ctx);exception    when others then        dbms_mle.drop_context(l_ctx);        raise;end;/You cannot use static import statements because DBMS_MLE evaluates JavaScript code in script mode.However, you can use dynamic imports as illustrated in the snippet above.  APEX and Database Actions are great tools because they allow you to focus on writing JavaScript (l_source_code in the above example).Related Documentation  Oracle® Database JavaScript Developer’s Guide.

          "content": "Security Considerations in Native ImageThe native-image builder generates a snapshot of an application after startup and bundles it in a binary executable.The security report section of the native image build output provides security relevant information about the native image build.Class InitializationThe native-image builder may execute the static initializers of certain classes at build time (see class initialization for more details).Executing static initializers at build time persists the state after initialization in the image heap.This means that any information that is obtained or computed in static initializers becomes part of a native executable.This can either result in sensitive data ending up in the snapshot or fixing initialization data that is supposed to be obtained at startup, such as random number seeds.Developers can request static initializers that process sensitive information to be executed at run time by specifying the --initialize-at-run-time CLI parameter when building a native executable, followed by a comma-separated list of packages and classes (and implicitly all of their subclasses) that must be initialized at runtime and not during image building.Alternatively developers can make use of the RuntimeClassInitialization API.Developers should run the native-image builder in a dedicated environment, such as a container, that does not contain any sensitive information in the first place.Software Bill of MaterialsGraalVM Native Image can embed a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) at build time to detect any libraries that may be susceptible to known security vulnerabilities.Native Image provides the --enable-sbom option to embed an SBOM into a native executable (only available in Oracle GraalVM).The CycloneDX format is supported and the default. To embed a CycloneDX SBOM into a native executable, pass the --enable-sbom option to the native-image command.The implementation constructs the SBOM by recovering all version information observable in external library manifests for classes included in a native executable. The SBOM is also compressed in order to limit the SBOM’s impact on the native executable size.The SBOM is stored in the gzip format with the exported sbom symbol referencing its start address and the sbom_length symbol its size.After embedding the compressed SBOM into the executable, the native image inspect tool is able to extract the compressed SBOM using an optional --sbom parameter accessible through $JAVA_HOME/bin/native-image-inspect --sbom &amp;lt;path_to_binary&amp;gt; from both executables and shared libraries.It outputs the SBOM in the following format:{  &quot;bomFormat&quot;: &quot;CycloneDX&quot;,  &quot;specVersion&quot;: &quot;1.4&quot;,  &quot;version&quot;: 1,  &quot;components&quot;: [    {      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;library&quot;,      &quot;group&quot;: &quot;io.netty&quot;,      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;netty-codec-http2&quot;,      &quot;version&quot;: &quot;4.1.76.Final&quot;,      &quot;properties&quot;: [        {          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;syft:cpe23&quot;,          &quot;value&quot;: &quot;cpe:2.3:a:codec:codec:4.1.76.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*&quot;        },        {          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;syft:cpe23&quot;,          &quot;value&quot;: &quot;cpe:2.3:a:codec:netty-codec-http2:4.1.76.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*&quot;        },        {          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;syft:cpe23&quot;,          &quot;value&quot;: &quot;cpe:2.3:a:codec:netty_codec_http2:4.1.76.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*&quot;        },        ...      ]    },    ...  ],  &quot;serialNumber&quot;: &quot;urn:uuid:51ec305f-616e-4139-a033-a094bb94a17c&quot;}To scan for any vulnerable libraries, submit the SBOM to a vulnerability scanner.For example, the popular Anchore software supply chain management platform makes the grype scanner freely available.You can check whether the libraries given in your SBOMs have known vulnerabilities documented in Anchore’s database.For this purpose, the output of the tool can be fed directly to the grype scanner to check for vulnerable libraries, using the command $JAVA_HOME/bin/native-image-inspect --sbom &amp;lt;path_to_binary&amp;gt; | grype which produces the following output:NAME                 INSTALLED      VULNERABILITY   SEVERITYnetty-codec-http2    4.1.76.Final   CVE-2022-24823  MediumYou can then use this report to update any vulnerable dependencies found in your executable.  Note that if native-image-inspect is used without the --sbom option, it will execute parts of the specified native binary to extract the method-level information.This functionality should not be used on native image executables from unknown or untrusted sources.Java serialization in Native ImageNative Image supports Serialization to help users deserialize the constructors for classes, contained in a native executable.Unless picked up by native image analysis automatically, these classes have to be pre-specified, as classes not contained in a native executable cannot be deserialized.Native Image cannot prevent exploitation of deserialization vulnerabilities in isolation.The serialization and deserialization Secure Coding Guidelines for Java SE should be followed.The security report section of the native image build output provides information on whether deserialization code is part of a native image’s attack surface or not.MiscellaneousSetting the security manager is not allowed. For more information see the compatibility documentation.Native Image provides multiple ways to specify a certificate file used to define the default TrustStore.While the default behavior for native-image is to capture and use the default TrustStore from the build-time host environment, this can be changed at run time by setting the “javax.net.ssl.trustStore*” system properties.See the documentation for more details.The directory containing the native executable is part of the search path when loading native libraries using System.loadLibrary() at run time.Native Image will not allow a Java Security Manager to be enabled because this functionality has now deprecated since Java 17.Attempting to set a security manager will trigger a runtime error.Related Documentation  Security Guide  Polyglot Sandboxing  Jipher JCE with Native Image",

          "content": "Optimize a Native Executable with Profile-Guided OptimizationsGraalVM Native Image offers quick startup and less memory consumption for a Java application, running as a native executable, by default. You can optimize this native executable even more for additional performance gain and higher throughput by applying Profile-Guided Optimizations (PGO).With PGO you can collect the profiling data in advance, and then feed it to the native-image tool, which will use this information to optimize the performance of a native application.The general workflow is:  Build an instrumented native executable by passing the --pgo-instrument option to native-image.  Run the instrumented executable to generate a profile file. By default, the default.iprof file is generated in the current working directory and on application shutdown.  Build an optimized executable. The profile file with the default name and location will be picked up automatically. Alternatively, you can pass it to the native-image builder by specifying the file path: --pgo=myprofile.iprof.You can specify where to collect the profiles when running an instrumented native executable by passing the -XX:ProfilesDumpFile=YourFileName option at run time. You can also collect multiple profile files by specifying different filenames, and pass them to native-image at build time.Note that executing all relevant application code paths and giving the application enough time to collect profiles are essential for having complete profiling information and therefore the best performance.  Note: PGO is not available in GraalVM Community Edition.Find more information on this topic in the Profile-Guided Optimization reference documentation.Run a DemoFor the demo part, you will run a Java application performing queries implemented with the Java Streams API. A user is expected to provide two integer arguments: the number of iterations and the length of the data array. The application creates the data set with a deterministic random seed and iterates 10 times. The time taken for each iteration  and its checksum is printed to the console.Below is the stream expression to optimize:Arrays.stream(persons)   .filter(p -&amp;gt; p.getEmployment() == Employment.EMPLOYED)   .filter(p -&amp;gt; p.getSalary() &amp;gt; 100_000)   .mapToInt(Person::getAge)   .filter(age -&amp;gt; age &amp;gt; 40)   .average()   .getAsDouble();Follow these steps to build an optimized native executable using PGO.PrerequisiteMake sure you have installed a GraalVM JDK.The easiest way to get started is with SDKMAN!.For other installation options, visit the Downloads section.  Save the following code to the file named Streams.java:    import java.util.Arrays;import java.util.Random;public class Streams {  static final double EMPLOYMENT_RATIO = 0.5;  static final int MAX_AGE = 100;  static final int MAX_SALARY = 200_000;  public static void main(String[] args) {    int iterations;    int dataLength;    try {      iterations = Integer.valueOf(args[0]);      dataLength = Integer.valueOf(args[1]);    } catch (Throwable ex) {      System.out.println(&quot;Expected 2 integer arguments: number of iterations, length of data array&quot;);      return;    }    Random random = new Random(42);    Person[] persons = new Person[dataLength];    for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; dataLength; i++) {      persons[i] = new Person(          random.nextDouble() &amp;gt;= EMPLOYMENT_RATIO ? Employment.EMPLOYED : Employment.UNEMPLOYED,          random.nextInt(MAX_SALARY),          random.nextInt(MAX_AGE));    }    long totalTime = 0;    for (int i = 1; i &amp;lt;= 20; i++) {      long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();      long checksum = benchmark(iterations, persons);      long iterationTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime;      totalTime += iterationTime;      System.out.println(&quot;Iteration &quot; + i + &quot; finished in &quot; + iterationTime + &quot; milliseconds with checksum &quot; + Long.toHexString(checksum));    }    System.out.println(&quot;TOTAL time: &quot; + totalTime);  }  static long benchmark(int iterations, Person[] persons) {    long checksum = 1;    for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; iterations; ++i) {      double result = getValue(persons);      checksum = checksum * 31 + (long) result;    }    return checksum;  }  public static double getValue(Person[] persons) {    return Arrays.stream(persons)        .filter(p -&amp;gt; p.getEmployment() == Employment.EMPLOYED)        .filter(p -&amp;gt; p.getSalary() &amp;gt; 100_000)        .mapToInt(Person::getAge)        .filter(age -&amp;gt; age &amp;gt;= 40).average()        .getAsDouble();  }}enum Employment {  EMPLOYED, UNEMPLOYED}class Person {  private final Employment employment;  private final int age;  private final int salary;  public Person(Employment employment, int height, int age) {    this.employment = employment;    this.salary = height;    this.age = age;  }  public int getSalary() {    return salary;  }  public int getAge() {    return age;  }  public Employment getEmployment() {    return employment;  }}    Compile the application:    javac Streams.java    (Optional) Run the demo application, providing some arguments to observe performance.    java Streams 100000 200    Build a native executable from the class file, and run it to compare the performance:     native-image Streams    An executable file, streams, is created in the current working directory.  Now run it with the same arguments to see the performance:     ./streams 100000 200    This version of the program is expected to run slower than on GraalVM’s or any regular JDK.    Build an instrumented native executable by passing the --pgo-instrument option to native-image:     native-image --pgo-instrument Streams    Run it to collect the code-execution-frequency profiles:     ./streams 100000 20    Notice that you can profile with a much smaller data size. Profiles collected from this run are stored by default in the default.iprof file.    Finally, build an optimized native executable. The profile file has the default name and location, so it will be picked up automatically:     native-image --pgo Streams    Run this optimized native executable timing the execution to see the system resources and CPU usage:     time ./streams 100000 200    You should get the performance comparable to, or faster, than the Java version of the program. For example, on a machine with 16 GB of memory and 8 cores, the TOTAL time for 10 iterations reduced from ~2200 to ~270 milliseconds.  This guide showed how you can optimize native executables for additional performance gain and higher throughput.Oracle GraalVM offers extra benefits for building native executables, such as Profile-Guided Optimizations (PGO). With PGO you “train” your application for specific workloads and significantly improve the performance.Related Documentation  Profile-Guided Optimization reference documentation  Optimize Cloud Native Java Apps with Oracle GraalVM PGO",

The execution mode automatically tunes the polyglot engine towards latency or throughput.          throughput collects the maximum amount of profiling information and compiles using the  maximum number of optimizations. This mode results in slower application startup  but better throughput. This mode uses the compiler configuration community or  enterprise if not specified otherwise.      default uses a balanced engine configuration. This mode uses the compiler configuration community or enterprise if not specified otherwise.      latency collects only minimal profiling information and compiles as fast as possible  with less optimal-generated code. This mode results in faster application  startup but less optimal throughput. This mode uses the compiler configuration  economy if not specified otherwise.      Passing Options to Language LaunchersEvery language launcher has been extended with a set of so called polyglot options.Polyglot options allow users of any language launcher to access the options of other languages supported by GraalVM (implemented with the Truffle language implementation framework).The format is: --&amp;lt;languageID&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;property&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;.For example, the R launcher also supports the --js.atomics=true JavaScript option.Allowed values for the languageID are:  js: options for JavaScript  python: options for Python  r: options for R  ruby: options for Ruby  llvm: options for LLVMUse --help:languages to find out which options are available.Options for polyglot tools work in the same way with the following format: --&amp;lt;toolID&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;property&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;.Allowed values for &amp;lt;toolID&amp;gt; are:  inspect: allows debugging with Chrome DevTools  cpusampler: collects data about CPU usage  cputracer: captures trace information about CPU usage  memtracer: captures trace information about memory usageUse --help:tools to find out which options are available.Passing Options ProgrammaticallyOptions can also be passed programmatically using the Java polyglot API.Create a file called OptionsTest.java:import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;class OptionsTest {    public static void main(String[] args) {        Context polyglot = Context.newBuilder()            .allowExperimentalOptions(true)            .option(&quot;js.shared-array-buffer&quot;, &quot;true&quot;)            .build();        // the use of shared array buffer requires the &#39;js.shared-array-buffer&#39; option to be &#39;true&#39;        polyglot.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;new SharedArrayBuffer(1024)&quot;);    }}Run:javac OptionsTest.javajava OptionsTest  Note: Tools options can be passed in the same way. Options cannot be modified after the context was created.Passing Options Using JVM ArgumentsEvery polyglot option can also be passed as a Java system property.Each available option translates to a system property with the polyglot. prefix.For example, -Dpolyglot.js.strict=true sets the default value for a strict interpretation for all JavaScript code that runs in the JVM.Options that were set programmatically take precedence over Java system properties.For languages the following format can be used: -Dpolyglot.&amp;lt;languageID&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;property&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt; and for tools it is: -Dpolyglot.&amp;lt;toolID&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;property&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;.Create a file called SystemPropertiesTest.java:import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;class SystemPropertiesTest {    public static void main(String[] args) {        Context polyglot = Context.newBuilder()        .allowExperimentalOptions(true)        .build();        // the use of shared array buffer requires the &#39;js.shared-array-buffer&#39; option to be &#39;true&#39;        polyglot.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;new SharedArrayBuffer(1024)&quot;);    }}Run:javac SystemPropertiesTest.javajava -Dpolyglot.js.strict=true SystemPropertiesTest  Note: System properties are read once when the polyglot context is created.

          "content": "Polyglot Programming and Debugging in VS CodeThe GraalVM Tools for Java extension enables a polyglot environment in VS Code, providing editing and debugging features for several popular languages such as Python, Ruby, R, JavaScript, and Node.JS.The extension supports polyglot programming in a bidirectional way: you can embed JavaScript, Ruby, R, and Python in Java, or call Java from those languages.A host language and a guest language can directly interoperate with each other and pass data back and forth in the same memory space.The GraalVM Tools for Java extension comes with full editing capabilities for JavaScript, Node.js, and Python by default. For Ruby and R development in VS Code you will need to additionally install languages servers.Besides that, the extension comes with a built-in implementation of the Language Server Protocol which adds more smart editing features such as code-completion, find usages, go to declaration, CodeLens, documentation on hover, and so on.The debugging features are provided for all supported languages by default.In this guide you will learn how to debug JavaScript and Node.JS, Python, Ruby, R applications one by one, read about the Language Server Protocol implementation and editing features.You can jump to the necessary section directly:  Debug Adapter Protocol Implementation  Debugging JavaScript and Node.js  Debugging Python  Debugging Ruby  Debugging R  Language Server Protocol Implementation  Running and Debugging Polyglot ApplicationsDebug Adapter Protocol ImplementationTogether with the native debugging capabilities, the extension is shipped with a built-in implementation of the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP).When creating the Run/Debug Configuration in VS Code, Chrome DevTools Protocol is provisioned by default.With the GraalVM Tools for Java extension, a user can choose a protocol to use by setting the protocol attribute in the corresponding debug configuration to either chromeDevTools or debugAdapter.To open a debugger port serving the Debug Adapter Protocol, you need to pass the --dap option to the command line launcher.Other available options to pass to GraalVM’s Debug Adapter Protocol are:  --dap.Suspend=false: Disable the execution suspension at the first source line, enabled by default.  --dap.WaitAttached: Do not execute any source code until debugger client is attached. The default is false.  --dap=&amp;lt;[[host:]port]&amp;gt;: Start the debugger on a different port than default (&amp;lt;host&amp;gt;:4711).Then you need a DAP client to connect to the open DAP port.For example, to connect to the open DAP port, the content of launch.json for a Node.js application, should look like the following:{    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.2.0&quot;,    &quot;configurations&quot;: [        {            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;graalvm&quot;,            &quot;request&quot;: &quot;launch&quot;,            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Launch Node App&quot;,            &quot;outputCapture&quot;: &quot;std&quot;,            &quot;protocol&quot;: &quot;debugAdapter&quot;,            &quot;program&quot;: &quot;${workspaceFolder}/App.js&quot;        }    ]}The advantage of using the Debug Adapter Protocol over Chrome Dev Tools is that it is “native” to VS Code, meaning it does not require any intermediate translation, and it supports multithreading, which can be particularly useful to debug, for example,  a Ruby application.Debugging JavaScript and Node.jsTo debug a JavaScript or Node.js application running on GraalVM, create a launch configuration for the application:  Go to File, then Open Folder to open the application project folder in VS Code.  Switch to the Debug view by clicking on the “bug” icon in the left-hand side panel. The newly opened window will suggest you create a launch.json file. If debugging is not yet configured (that is, no launch.json has been created), select GraalVM from the list of available debug environments.  Once the launch.json file is opened, one of the following techniques can be used to add a new configuration:          Use code completion if your cursor is located inside the configurations array.      Click Add Configuration to invoke IntelliSense snippet suggestions at the start of the array.      Choose Add Configuration in the Debug menu.            Choose one of the launch configurations:              Note: The attributes available in launch configurations vary from configuration to configuration. You can use IntelliSense suggestions (Ctrl+Space) to discover which attributes exist for a specific debug configuration. Hover help is also available for all attributes.      To start a debug session:  Select the appropriate configuration from the Configuration drop-down list in the Debug view.  Once you have your launch configuration set, start your debug session with F5. Alternatively, you can run your configuration through View, then Command Palette (use the Ctrl+Shift+P  hot keys combination for Linux, or Command+Shift+P for macOS).  Set filtering to Debug: Select and Start Debugging, or type “debug” and select the configuration you want to debug.The GraalVM extension provides the following debug configurations that can be used to run and debug JavaScript and Node.js applications running on GraalVM:  Launch Node.js Application launches a Node.js application with GraalVM in a debug mode.  Launch JavaScript launches a JavaScript application with GraalVM in a debug mode.  Attach attaches a debugger to a locally running GraalVM runtime.  Attach to Remote attaches a debugger to the debug port of a remote GraalVM runtime.You also can choose which debugging protocol to use (Debug Adapter Protocol or Chrome Dev Tools protocol) by setting the protocol attribute in the corresponding debug configuration to either chromeDevTools or debugAdapter.For example, to connect to the open Debug Adapter Protocol port, the content of the launch.json should be:{    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.2.0&quot;,    &quot;configurations&quot;: [        {            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;graalvm&quot;,            &quot;request&quot;: &quot;launch&quot;,            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Launch Node App&quot;,            &quot;outputCapture&quot;: &quot;std&quot;,            &quot;protocol&quot;: &quot;debugAdapter&quot;,            &quot;program&quot;: &quot;${workspaceFolder}/App.js&quot;        }    ]}Debugging PythonTo debug a Python application running on GraalVM, create a launch configuration for the application:  Go to File, then Open Folder to open the application project folder in VS Code.

Launch R Terminal launches an integrated R terminal running on GraalVM in a debug mode.      You also can choose which debugging protocol to use (Debug Adapter Protocol or Chrome Dev Tools protocol) by setting the protocol attribute in the corresponding debug configuration to either chromeDevTools or debugAdapter.For example, to connect to the Chrome Dev Tools protocol port, the content of the launch.json should be:{    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.2.0&quot;,    &quot;configurations&quot;: [        {            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;graalvm&quot;,            &quot;request&quot;: &quot;launch&quot;,            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Launch R Script&quot;,            &quot;outputCapture&quot;: &quot;std&quot;,            &quot;protocol&quot;: &quot;chromeDevTools&quot;,            &quot;program&quot;: &quot;${workspaceFolder}/App.r&quot;        }    ]}Language Server Protocol ImplementationGraalVM provides a built-in implementation of the Language Server Protocol.which allows users to attach compatible development tools such as VS Code to GraalVM and adds more smart editing features such as code-completion, find usages, go to declaration, CodeLens, documentation on hover.Currently, GraalVM’s Language Server Protocol implementation supports the following services:  Text Document Synchronization  Hover Provider  Completion Provider  Signature Help Provider  Document Highlight Provider  Code Action Provider  CodeLens Provider  Execute Command Provider  Note: The Language Server Protocol is offered as a technology preview and requires to pass the --experimental-options option for its activation.To start the Language Server Protocol, pass the --lsp option to the command line launcher as in the following example with a Node.js application:  node --experimental-options --lsp app.js  [Graal LSP] Starting server and listening on localhost/127.0.0.1:8123  Example app listening on port 3000!This extension works as a client to the Language Server Protocol.By default, a language server is started as a part of every process being executed or debugged via the VS Code user interface.The other possibility (available on option) is a language server started as a separated process that is informed about every application being executed or debugged.It tries to “dry-run” the same code as the original application and serve the run-time data afterwards.Currently, both approaches start the language server, providing the smart editing features for the following GraalVM-supported languages - JavaScript, Python, R, Ruby, and SimpleLanguage.  Important: GraalVM’s Language Server Protocol itself does not provide the static data usually gathered by parsing the application sources (as these data are sometimes fuzzy in the case of dynamic languages). Instead, it was designed to provide the accurate dynamic data gathered from the application runtime.GraalVM’s Language Server Protocol implementation can delegate to the existing language servers written specially for the particular languages (using the --lsp.Delegates launcher option) and merge the static data returned from these servers with its own dynamic data to a single result.Ruby and R Language ServersThe GraalVM Tools for Java extension comes with default editing features for JavaScript, Node.js, and Python. For Ruby and R development in VS Code you will need to additionally install languages servers.Ruby Language ServerThe GraalVM Tools for Java extension provides an option to automatically install and run solargraph, which is an implementation of the Language Server Protocol for the Ruby language.Enabling this option, the GraalVM installation is checked for the presence of the solargraph gem and the user is offered  the option of automatically installing the missing gem.Once the solargraph gem is installed, the Ruby Language Server is automatically started and passed to the Language Server Protocol as delegate when necessary.R Language ServerThe GraalVM Tools for Java extension provides an option to automatically install and run languageserver, which is an implementation of the Language Server Protocol for R.Enabling this option, the GraalVM installation is checked for the presence of the languageserver package and the user is offered the option of automatically installing the missing package.Once the languageserver package is installed, the R Language Server is automatically started and passed to the Language Server Protocol as delegate when necessary.Running and Debugging Polyglot ApplicationsGraalVM Polyglot API enables you to combine multiple languages (supported by GraalVM) in one program.The combination can be bidirectional: you can embed JavaScript, Ruby, R, and Python in Java, or call Java from those languages.A host language and a guest language can directly interoperate with each other and pass data back and forth in the same memory space.For more information, see the Polyglot Programming guide.To run a polyglot application on GraalVM, you have to either pass the --polyglot option to any of the existing application launchers (for example, js --polyglot or node --polyglot), or use an experimental launcher called polyglot that runs code for JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and R without requiring the selection of a primary language.The polyglot launcher does not require the --polyglot option, because it is enabled by default.  Note: In some cases (such as a polyglot application calling Java or R, or a native launcher accessing languages installed with gu) passing the --jvm option may be necessary.To debug a polyglot application on GraalVM in VS Code, you create a launch configuration for the application:  Go to File, then Open Folder to open the application project folder in VS Code.  Switch to the Debug view by clicking on the “bug” icon in the left-hand side panel. The newly opened window will suggest you create a launch.json file. If debugging is not yet configured (no launch.json has been created), select GraalVM from the list of available debug environments.  Once the launch.json file is opened, one of the following techniques can be used to add a new configuration:          Use code completion if your cursor is located inside the configurations array.      Click Add Configuration to invoke IntelliSense snippet suggestions at the start of the array.      Choose Add Configuration in the Debug menu.            Select Launch Polyglot Application  to launch a polyglot application in a debug mode.      You can choose which debugging protocol, (Debug Adapter Protocol or Chrome Dev Tools protocol, to use to debug a polyglot application by setting the protocol attribute in the corresponding debug configuration to either chromeDevTools or debugAdapter.For example, to connect to the Chrome Dev Tools protocol port, the content of the launch.json can be:{    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.2.0&quot;,    &quot;configurations&quot;: [        {            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;graalvm&quot;,            &quot;request&quot;: &quot;launch&quot;,            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Launch Polyglot App&quot;,            &quot;outputCapture&quot;: &quot;std&quot;,            &quot;protocol&quot;: &quot;chromeDevTools&quot;,            &quot;program&quot;: &quot;${workspaceFolder}/polyglot.js&quot;        }    ]}Alternatively, to pass the --polyglot option to any of the existing application launchers, add the runtimeArgs attribute containing the --polyglot value to their respective debug configurations.Additional Editor FeaturesSince the easy writing of polyglot applications is one of the defining features of GraalVM, the code completion invoked inside JavaScript sources provides items for Polyglot.eval(...), Polyglot.evalFile(...), and Java.type(...) calls.Similarly, the code completion invoked inside Python sources provides items for Polyglot.eval(...), Polyglot.eval_file(...), and Java.type(...) calls.The code completion invoked inside R sources provides items for eval.polyglot(...) and new(&quot;&amp;lt;Java type&amp;gt;&quot;, ...) calls.And finally, the code completion invoked inside Ruby sources provides items for Polyglot.eval(...), Polyglot.eval_file(...), and Java.type(...) calls.For JavaScript, Python, R, and Ruby sources opened in the editor, all the Polyglot.eval(...) calls are detected and the respective embedded languages are injected to their locations.For example, having an R code snippet called via the Polyglot API from inside a JavaScript source, the R language code is embedded inside the corresponding JavaScript String and all VS Code’s editing features (syntax highlighting, bracket matching, auto closing pairs, code completion, etc.) treat the content of the String as the R source code.Related Documentation  Polyglot Programming",

          "title": "Polyglot Sandboxing",
          "content": "Polyglot SandboxingGraalVM allows a host application written in a JVM-based language to execute guest code written in Javascript via the Polyglot Embedding API.Configured with a sandbox policy, a security boundary between a host application and guest code can be established.For example, host code can execute untrusted guest code using the UNTRUSTED policy.Host code can also execute multiple mutually distrusting instances of guest code that will be protected from one another.Used this way, polyglot sandboxing supports a multi-tenant scenario:Use cases that benefit from introducing a security boundary are:  Usage of third party code, i.e., pulling in a dependency. Third party code is typically trusted and scanned for vulnerabilities before use, but sandboxing them is an additional precaution against supply-chain attacks.  User plugins. Complex applications might allow users to install community-written plugins. Traditionally, those plugins are considered trusted and often run with full privileges, but ideally they should not be able to interfere with the application except when intended.  Server scripting. Allowing users to customize a server application with their own logic expressed in a general-purpose scripting language, for example, to implement custom data processing on a shared data source.Sandbox PoliciesDepending on the use case and the associated acceptable security risk, a SandboxPolicy can be chosen, ranging from TRUSTED to UNTRUSTED, enabling and configuring an increasing range of restrictions and mitigations.A SandboxPolicy serves two purposes: preconfiguration and validation of the final configuration.It preconfigures context and engine to comply to a policy by default.In case the configuration is further customized, validation of the policy will ensure that the custom configuration does not unacceptably weaken the policy.Trusted PolicyThe TRUSTED sandboxing policy is intended for guest code that is entirely trusted.This is the default mode.There are no restrictions to the context or engine configuration.Example:try (Context context = Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;)                              .sandbox(SandboxPolicy.TRUSTED)                              .build();) {    context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;print(&#39;Hello JavaScript!&#39;);&quot;);}Constrained PolicyThe CONSTRAINED sandboxing policy is intended for trusted applications whose access to host resources should be regulated.The CONSTRAINED policy:  Requires the languages for a context to be set.  Disallows native access.  Disallows process creation.  Disallows system exit, prohibiting the guest code from terminating the entire VM where this is supported by the language.  Requires redirection of the standard output and error streams. This is to mitigate risks where external components, such as log processing, may be confused by unexpected writes to output streams by guest code.  Disallows host file or socket access. Only custom polyglot file system implementations are allowed.  Disallows environment access.  Restricts host access:          Disallows host class loading.      Disallows to all public host classes and methods by default.      Disallows access inheritance.      Disallows implementation of arbitrary host classes and interfaces.      Disallows implementation of java.lang.FunctionalInterface.      Disallows host object mappings of mutable target types.The HostAccess.CONSTRAINED host access policy is preconfigured to fulfil the requirements for the CONSTRAINED sandboxing policy.      Example:try (Context context = Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;)                              .sandbox(SandboxPolicy.CONSTRAINED)                              .out(new ByteArrayOutputStream())                              .err(new ByteArrayOutputStream())                              .build()) {    context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;print(&#39;Hello JavaScript!&#39;);&quot;);}Isolated PolicyThe ISOLATED sandboxing policy builds on top of the CONSTRAINED policy and is intended for trusted applications that may misbehave because of implementation bugs or processing of untrusted input.As the name already suggests, the ISOLATED policy enforces deeper isolation between host and guest code.In particular, guest code running with the ISOLATED policy will be executed in their own virtual machine, on a separate heap.This means that they no longer share runtime elements such as the JIT compiler or the garbage collector with the host application, making the host VM significantly more resilient against faults in the guest VM.In addition to the restrictions of the CONSTRAINED policy, the ISOLATED policy:  Requires method scoping to be enabled. This avoids cyclic dependencies between host and guest objects. The HostAccess.ISOLATED host access policy is preconfigured to fulfil the requirements for the ISOLATED sandboxing policy.  Requires setting the maximum isolate heap size. This is the heap size that will be used by the guest VM. If the engine is shared by multiple contexts, execution of these contexts will share the isolate heap.  Requires setting the host call stack headroom. This protects against host stack starving on upcalls to the host: the guest will be prohibited from performing an upcall if the remaining stack size drops below the specified value.  Requires setting the maximum CPU time limit. This restricts the workload to execute within the given time frame.Example:try (Context context = Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;)                              .sandbox(SandboxPolicy.ISOLATED)                              .out(new ByteArrayOutputStream())                              .err(new ByteArrayOutputStream())                              .option(&quot;engine.MaxIsolateMemory&quot;, &quot;256MB&quot;)                              .option(&quot;sandbox.MaxCPUTime&quot;, &quot;2s&quot;)                              .build()) {    context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;print(&#39;Hello JavaScript!&#39;);&quot;);}Since Polyglot version 23.1, the isolated and untrusted policy also requires isolated images of the languages to be specified on the class or module path.Isolated versions of the languages can be downloaded from Maven using the following dependency:&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.polyglot&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;js-isolate&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;${graalvm.version}&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;pom&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;The embedding guide contains more details on using polyglot isolate dependencies.Untrusted PolicyThe UNTRUSTED sandboxing policy builds on top of the ISOLATED policy and is intended to mitigate risks from running actual untrusted code.The attack surface of GraalVM when running untrusted code consists of the entire guest VM that executes the code as well as the host entry points made available to guest code.In addition to the restrictions of the ISOLATED policy, the UNTRUSTED policy:  Requires redirection of the standard input stream.  Requires setting the maximum memory consumption of the guest code. This is a limit in addition to the maximum isolate heap size backed by a mechanism that keeps track of the size of objects allocated by the guest code on the guest VM heap. This limit can be thought of as a “soft” memory limit, whereas the isolate heap size is the “hard” limit.  Requires setting the maximum number of stack frames that can be pushed on the stack by guest code. This limit can protect against unbounded recursion to exhaust the stack.  Requires setting the maximum AST depth of the guest code. Together with the stack frame limit, this puts a bound on the stack space consumed by guest code.  Requires setting the maximum output and error stream sizes. As output and error streams have to be redirected, the receiving ends are on the host side. Limiting the output and error stream sizes protects against availability issues on the host.  Requires untrusted code mitigations to be enabled. Untrusted code mitigations address risks from JIT spraying and speculative execution attacks. They include constant blinding as well as comprehensive use of speculative execution barriers.  Further restricts host access to ensure there are no implicit entry points to host code. This means that guest-code access to host arrays, lists, maps, buffers, iterables and iterators is disallowed. The reason is that there may be various implementations of these APIs on the host side, resulting in implicit entry points. In addition, direct mappings of guest implementations to host interfaces via HostAccess.Builder#allowImplementationsAnnotatedBy are disallowed. The HostAccess.UNTRUSTED host access policy is preconfigured to fulfil the requirements for the UNTRUSTED sandboxing policy.Example:try (Context context = Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;)                              .sandbox(SandboxPolicy.UNTRUSTED)                              .in(new ByteArrayInputStream(&quot;foobar&quot;.getBytes()))                              .out(new ByteArrayOutputStream())                              .err(new ByteArrayOutputStream())                              .allowHostAccess(HostAccess.UNTRUSTED)                              .option(&quot;engine.MaxIsolateMemory&quot;, &quot;1024MB&quot;)                              .option(&quot;sandbox.MaxHeapMemory&quot;, &quot;128MB&quot;)                              .option(&quot;sandbox.MaxCPUTime&quot;,&quot;2s&quot;)                              .option(&quot;sandbox.MaxStatements&quot;,&quot;50000&quot;)                              .option(&quot;sandbox.MaxStackFrames&quot;,&quot;2&quot;)                              .option(&quot;sandbox.MaxThreads&quot;,&quot;1&quot;)                              .option(&quot;sandbox.MaxASTDepth&quot;,&quot;10&quot;)                              .option(&quot;sandbox.MaxOutputStreamSize&quot;,&quot;32B&quot;)                              .option(&quot;sandbox.MaxErrorStreamSize&quot;,&quot;0B&quot;);                              .build()) {    context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;print(&#39;Hello JavaScript!&#39;);&quot;);}For further information on how to set the resource limits, please refer to the corresponding guidance.Host AccessGraalVM allows exchanging objects between host and guest code and exposing host methods to guest code.When exposing host methods to less privileged guest code, these methods become part of the attack surface of the more privileged host code.Therefore the sandboxing policies already restrict host access in the CONSTRAINED policy to make host entry points explicit.HostAccess.CONSTRAINED is the pre-defined host access policy for the CONSTRAINED sandbox policy.To expose a host class method, it has to be annotated with @HostAccess.Export.This annotation is not inherited.Service providers such as polyglot file system implementations or output stream recipients for standard output and error stream redirections are exposed to guest code invocations.Guest code can also implement a Java interface that has been annotated with @Implementable.Host code using such an interface directly interacts with guest code.Host code that interacts with guest code has to be implemented in a robust manner:  Input validation. All data passed from the guest, e.g. via parameters to an exposed method, is untrusted and should be thorougly validated by host code where applicable.  Reentrancy. Exposed host code should be reentrant as guest code may invoke it at any time. Do note that simply applying the synchronized keyword to a code block does not necessarily make it reentrant.  Thread-safety. Exposed host code should be thread-safe as guest code may invoke them from multiple threads at the same time.  Resource consumption. Exposed host code should be aware of its resource consumption. In particular, constructs that allocate memory based on untrusted input data, either directly or indirectly, e.g. through recursion, should either be avoided altogether or implement limits.  Privileged functionality. Restrictions enforced by the sandbox can be entirely bypassed by exposing host methods that provide restricted functionality. For example, guest code with a CONSTRAINED sandbox policy cannot perform host file IO operations. However, exposing a host method to the context that allows writing to arbitrary files effectively bypasses this restriction.  Side channels. Depending on the guest language, guest code may have access to timing information. For example, in Javascript the Date() object provides fine-grained timing information. In the UNTRUSTED sandbox policy the granularity of Javascript timers is pre-configured to one second and can be lowered to 100 milliseconds. However, host code should be aware that guest code may time its execution, potentially discovering secret information if the host code performs secret-depending processing.Host code that is unaware of interacting with untrusted guest code should never be directly exposed to guest code without taking the aforementioned aspects into account.As an example, an antipattern would be to implement a third party interface and forwarding all method invocations to guest code.Resource LimitsThe ISOLATED and UNTRUSTED sandbox policies require setting resource limits for a context.Different configurations can be provided for each context.If a limit is exceeded, evaluation of the code fails and the context is canceled with a PolyglotException which returns true for isResourceExhausted().At this point, no more guest code can be executed in the contextThe --sandbox.TraceLimits option allows you to trace guest code and record the maximum resource utilization.This can be used to estimate the parameters for the sandbox.For example, a web server’s sandbox parameters could be obtained by enabling this option and either stress-testing the server, or letting the server run during peak usage.When this option is enabled, the report is saved to the log file after the workload completes.Users can change the location of the log file by using --log.file=&amp;lt;path&amp;gt; with a language launcher or -Dpolyglot.log.file=&amp;lt;path&amp;gt; when using a java launcher.Each resource limit in the report can be passed directly to a sandbox option to enforce the limit.See, for example, how to trace limits for a Python workload:graalpy --log.file=limits.log --sandbox.TraceLimits=true workload.pylimits.log:Traced Limits:Maximum Heap Memory:                                        12MBCPU Time:                                                     7sNumber of statements executed:                           9441565Maximum active stack frames:                                  29Maximum number of threads:                                     1Maximum AST Depth:                                            15Size written to standard output:                              4BSize written to standard error output:                        0BRecommended Programmatic Limits:Context.newBuilder()            .option(&quot;sandbox.MaxHeapMemory&quot;, &quot;2MB&quot;)            .option(&quot;sandbox.MaxCPUTime&quot;,&quot;10ms&quot;)            .option(&quot;sandbox.MaxStatements&quot;,&quot;1000&quot;)            .option(&quot;sandbox.MaxStackFrames&quot;,&quot;64&quot;)            .option(&quot;sandbox.MaxThreads&quot;,&quot;1&quot;)            .option(&quot;sandbox.MaxASTDepth&quot;,&quot;64&quot;)            .option(&quot;sandbox.MaxOutputStreamSize&quot;,&quot;1024KB&quot;)            .option(&quot;sandbox.MaxErrorStreamSize&quot;,&quot;1024KB&quot;)            .build();Recommended Command Line Limits:--sandbox.MaxHeapMemory=12MB --sandbox.MaxCPUTime=7s --sandbox.MaxStatements=9441565 --sandbox.MaxStackFrames=64 --sandbox.MaxThreads=1 --sandbox.MaxASTDepth=64 --sandbox.MaxOutputStreamSize=1024KB --sandbox.MaxErrorStreamSize=1024KBRe-profiling may be required if the workload changes or when switching to a different major GraalVM version.Certain limits can be reset at any point of time during the execution.Limiting active CPU timeThe sandbox.MaxCPUTime option allows you to specify the maximum CPU time spent running guest code.CPU time spent depends on the underlying hardware.The maximum CPU time specifies how long a context can be active until it is automatically cancelled and the context is closed.By default the time limit is checked every 10 milliseconds.This can be customized using the sandbox.MaxCPUTimeCheckInterval option.As soon as the time limit is triggered, no further guest code can be executed with this context.It will continuously throw a PolyglotException for any method of the polyglot context that will be invoked.The used CPU time of a context includes time spent in callbacks to host code.The used CPU time of a context typically does not include time spent waiting for synchronization or IO.The CPU time of all threads will be added and checked against the CPU time limit.This can mean that if two threads execute the same context then the time limit will be exceeded twice as fast.The time limit is enforced by a separate high-priority thread that will be woken regularly.There is no guarantee that the context will be cancelled within the accuracy specified.The accuracy may be significantly missed, e.g. if the host VM causes a full garbage collection.If the time limit is never exceeded then the throughput of the guest context is not affected.If the time limit is exceeded for one context then it may slow down the throughput for other contexts with the same explicit engine temporarily.Available units to specify time durations are ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours and d for days.Both maximum CPU time limit and check interval must be positive followed by a time unit.try (Context context = Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;)                           .option(&quot;sandbox.MaxCPUTime&quot;, &quot;500ms&quot;)                       .build();) {    context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;while(true);&quot;);    assert false;} catch (PolyglotException e) {    // triggered after 500ms;    // context is closed and can no longer be used    // error message: Maximum CPU time limit of 500ms exceeded.    assert e.isCancelled();    assert e.isResourceExhausted();}Limiting the number of executed statementsSpecifies the maximum number of statements a context may execute until it is cancelled.After the statement limit was triggered for a context, it is no longer usable and every use of the context will throw a PolyglotException that returns true for PolyglotException.isCancelled().The statement limit is independent of the number of threads executing.The limit may be set to a negative number to disable it.Whether this limit is applied internal sources only can be configured using sandbox.MaxStatementsIncludeInternal.By default the limit does not include statements of sources that are marked internal.If a shared engine is used then the same internal configuration must be used for all contexts of an engine.The complexity of a single statement may not be constant time depending on the guest language.For example, statements that execute Javascript builtins, like Array.sort, may account for a single statement, but its execution time is dependent on the size of the array.try (Context context = Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;)                           .option(&quot;sandbox.MaxStatements&quot;, &quot;2&quot;)                           .option(&quot;sandbox.MaxStatementsIncludeInternal&quot;, &quot;false&quot;)                       .build();) {    context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;purpose = 41&quot;);    context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;purpose++&quot;);    context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;purpose++&quot;); // triggers max statements    assert false;} catch (PolyglotException e) {    // context is closed and can no longer be used    // error message: Maximum statements limit of 2 exceeded.    assert e.isCancelled();    assert e.isResourceExhausted();}AST depth limitA limit on the maximum expression depth of a guest language function.Only instrumentable nodes count towards the limit.The AST depth can give an estimate of the complexity of a function as well as its stack frame size.Limiting the number of stack framesSpecifies the maximum number of frames a context can push on the stack.A thread-local stack frame counter is incremented on function enter and decremented on function return.The stack frame limit in itself serves as a safeguard against infinite recursion.Together with the AST depth limit it can restrict total stack space usage.Limiting the number of active threadsLimits the number of threads that can be used by a context at the same point in time.Multi-threading is not supported in the UNTRUSTED sandbox policy.Heap memory limitsThe sandbox.MaxHeapMemory option specifies the maximum heap memory guest code is allowed to retain during its run.Only objects residing in guest code count towards the limit - memory allocated during callbacks to host code does not.This is not a hard limit as the efficacy of this option (also) depends on the garbage collector used.This means that the limit may be exceeded by guest code.try (Context context = Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;)                           .option(&quot;sandbox.MaxHeapMemory&quot;, &quot;100MB&quot;)                       .build()) {    context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;var r = {}; var o = r; while(true) { o.o = {}; o = o.o; };&quot;);    assert false;} catch (PolyglotException e) {    // triggered after the retained size is greater than 100MB;    // context is closed and can no longer be used    // error message: Maximum heap memory limit of 104857600 bytes exceeded. Current memory at least...    assert e.isCancelled();    assert e.isResourceExhausted();}The limit is checked by retained size computation triggered either based on allocated bytes or on low memory notification.The allocated bytes are checked by a separate high-priority thread that will be woken regularly.There is one such thread for each memory-limited context (one with sandbox.MaxHeapMemory set).The retained bytes computation is done by yet another high-priority thread that is started from the allocated bytes checking thread as needed.The retained bytes computation thread also cancels the context if the heap memory limit is exeeded.Additionaly, when the low memory trigger is invoked, all contexts on engines with at least one memory-limited context are paused together with their allocation checkers.All individual retained size computations are cancelled.Retained bytes in the heap for each memory-limited context are computed by a single high-priority thread.The heap memory limit will not prevent the context from causing OutOfMemory errors.Guest code that allocates many objects in quick succession has a lower accuracy compared to code that allocates objects rarely.Retained size computation for a context can be customized using the expert options sandbox.AllocatedBytesCheckInterval, sandbox.AllocatedBytesCheckEnabled, sandbox.AllocatedBytesCheckFactor, sandbox.RetainedBytesCheckInterval, sandbox.RetainedBytesCheckFactor, and sandbox.UseLowMemoryTrigger described below.Retained size computation for a context is triggered when a retained bytes estimate exceeds a certain factor of specified sandbox.MaxHeapMemory.The estimate is based on heap memoryallocated by threads where the context has been active.More precisely, the estimate is the result of previous retained bytes computation, if available, plus bytes allocated since the start of the previous computation.By default the factor of sandbox.MaxHeapMemory is 1.0 and it can be customized by the sandbox.AllocatedBytesCheckFactor option.The factor must be positive.For example, let sandbox.MaxHeapMemory be 100MB and sandbox.AllocatedBytesCheckFactor be 0.5.The retained size computation is first triggered when allocated bytes reach 50MB.Let the computed retained size be 25MB, then the next retained size computation is triggered when additional 25MB is allocated, etc.By default, allocated bytes are checked every 10 milliseconds. This can be configured by sandbox.AllocatedBytesCheckInterval.The smallest possible interval is 1ms. Any smaller value is interpreted as 1ms.The beginnings of two retained size computations of the same context must be by default at least 10 milliseconds apart.This can be configured by the sandbox.RetainedBytesCheckInterval option. The interval must be positive.The allocated bytes checking for a context can be disabled by the sandbox.AllocatedBytesCheckEnabled option.By default it is enabled (“true”). If disabled (“false”), retained size checking for the context can be triggered only by the low memory trigger.When the total number of bytes allocated in the heap for the whole host VM exceeds a certain factor of the total heap memory of the VM, low memory notification is invoked and initiates the following process.The execution for all engines with at least one execution context which has the sandbox.MaxHeapMemory option set is paused, retained bytes in the heap for each memory-limited context are computed, contexts exceeding their limits are cancelled, and then the execution is resumed.The default factor is 0.7. This can be configured by the sandbox.RetainedBytesCheckFactor option.The factor must be between 0.0 and 1.0. All contexts using the sandbox.MaxHeapMemory option must use the same value for sandbox.RetainedBytesCheckFactor.When the usage threshold or the collection usage threshold of any heap memory pool has already been set, then the low memory trigger cannot be used by default, because the limit specified by the sandbox.RetainedBytesCheckFactor cannot be implemented.However, when sandbox.ReuseLowMemoryTriggerThreshold is set to true and the usage threshold or the collection usage threshold of a heap memory pool has already been set, then the value of sandbox.RetainedBytesCheckFactor is ignored for that memory pool and whatever limit has already been set is used.That way the low memory trigger can be used together with libraries that also set the usage threshold or the collection usage threshold of heap memory pools.The described low memory trigger can be disabled by the sandbox.UseLowMemoryTrigger option.By default it is enabled (“true”). If disabled (“false”), retained size checking for the execution context can be triggered only by the allocated bytes checker.All contexts using the sandbox.MaxHeapMemory option must use the same value for sandbox.UseLowMemoryTrigger.Limiting the amount of data written to standard output and error streamsLimits the size of the output that guest code writes to standard output or standard error output during runtime.Limiting the size of the output can serve as protection against denial-of-service attacks that flood the output.try (Context context = Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;)                           .option(&quot;sandbox.MaxOutputStreamSize&quot;, &quot;100KB&quot;)                       .build()) {    context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;while(true) { console.log(&#39;Log message&#39;) };&quot;);    assert false;} catch (PolyglotException e) {    // triggered after writing more than 100KB to stdout    // context is closed and can no longer be used    // error message: Maximum output stream size of 102400 exceeded. Bytes written 102408.    assert e.isCancelled();    assert e.isResourceExhausted();}try (Context context = Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;)                           .option(&quot;sandbox.MaxErrorStreamSize&quot;, &quot;100KB&quot;)                       .build()) {    context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;while(true) { console.error(&#39;Error message&#39;) };&quot;);    assert false;} catch (PolyglotException e) {    // triggered after writing more than 100KB to stderr    // context is closed and can no longer be used    // error message: Maximum error stream size of 102400 exceeded. Bytes written 102410.    assert e.isCancelled();    assert e.isResourceExhausted();}Resetting Resource LimitsIt is possible to reset the limits at any point in time using the Context.resetLimits method.This can be useful if a known and trusted initialization script should be excluded from limit.Only the statement, cpu time and output / error stream limits can be reset.try (Context context = Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;)                           .option(&quot;sandbox.MaxCPUTime&quot;, &quot;500ms&quot;)                       .build();) {    context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, /*... initialization script ...*/);    context.resetLimits();    context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, /*... user script ...*/);    assert false;} catch (PolyglotException e) {    assert e.isCancelled();    assert e.isResourceExhausted();}Runtime DefensesThe main defense enforced by the ISOLATED and UNTRUSTED sandbox policy through the engine.SpawnIsolate option is that the Polyglot engine runs in a dedicated native-image isolate, moving execution of guest code to a VM-level fault domain separate from the host application, with its own heap, garbage collector and JIT compiler.Apart from setting a hard limit for the memory consumption of guest code via the guest’s heap size, it also allows to focus runtime defenses just on guest code and not cause performance degredation of host code.The runtime defenses are enabled by the engine.UntrustedCodeMitigation option.Constant BlindingJIT compilers allow users to provide source code and, given the source code is valid, compile it to machine code.From an attacker’s perspective, JIT compilers compile attacker-controlled inputs to predictable bytes in executable memory.In an attack called JIT spraying an attacker leverages the predictable compilation by feeding malicious input programs into the JIT compiler, thereby forcing it to emit code containing Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) gadgets.Constants in the input program are a particularly attractive target for such an attack, since JIT compilers often include them verbatim in the machine code.Constant blinding aims to invalidate an attacker’s predictions by introducing randomness into the compilation process.Specifically, constant blinding encrypts constants with a random key at compile time and decrypts them at runtime at each occurrence.Only the encrypted version of the constant appears verbatim in the machine code.Absent knowledge of the random key, the attacker cannot predict the encrypted constant value and, therefore, can no longer predict the resulting bytes in executable memory.GraalVM blinds all immediate values and data embedded in code pages of runtime compiled guest code down to a size of four bytes.Randomized Function Entry PointsA predictable code layout makes it easier for attackers to find gadgets that have been introduced, for example, via the aforementioned JIT spray attack.While runtime compiled methods are already placed in memory that is subject to address space layout randomization (ASLR) by the operating system, GraalVM additionally pads the starting offset of functions with a random number of trap instructions.Speculative Execution Attack MitigationsSpeculative execution attacks such as Spectre exploit the fact that a CPU may transiently execute instructions based on branch prediction information.In the case of a misprediction, the result of these instructions is discarded.However, the execution may have caused side effects in the micro-architectural state of a CPU.For example, data may have been pulled into the cache during transient execution - a side-channel that can be read by timing data access.GraalVM protects against Spectre attacks by inserting speculative execution barrier instructions in runtime compiled guest code to prevent attackers from crafting speculative execution gadgets.A speculative execution barrier is placed at each target of a conditional branch that is relevant to Java memory safety to stop speculative execution.Sharing Execution EnginesGuest code of different trust domains has to be separated at the Polylgot engine level, i.e. only guest code of the same trust domain should share an engine.When multiple context share an engine, all of them must have the same sandbox policy (the engine’s sandbox policy).Application developers may choose to share execution engines among execution contexts for performance reasons.While the context holds the state of the executed code, the engine holds the code itself.Sharing of an execution engine among multiple contexts needs to be set up explicitly and can increase performance in scenarios where a number of contexts execute the same code. In scenarios where contexts that share an execution engine for common code also execute sensitive (i.e., private) code, the corresponding source objects can opt out from code sharing with:Source.newBuilder(…).cached(false).build()Compatibility and LimitationsPolyglot sandboxing is not available in GraalVM Community Edition.Depending on the sandboxing policy, only a subset of Truffle languages, instruments, and options are available.In particular, sandboxing is currently only supported for the runtime’s default version of ECMAScript, i.e. ECMAScript 2022.Sandboxing is also not supported from within GraalVM’s Node.js.Polyglot sandboxing is not compatible with modifications to the VM setup via e.g. system properties that change the behavior of the VM.The sandboxing policy is subject to incompatible changes across major GraalVM releases to maintain a secure-by-default posture.Polyglot sandboxing cannot protect against vulnerabilities in its operating environment, i.e. vulnerabilities in the operating system or the underlying hardware.We recommend to adopt the appropriate external isolation primitives to protect against corresponding risks.Differentiation with Java Security ManagerThe Java Security Manager is deprecated in Java 17 with JEP-411.The purpose of the security manager is stated as follows: “It allows an application to determine, before performing a possibly unsafe or sensitive operation, what the operation is and whether it is being attempted in a security context that allows the operation to be performed.”The goal of the GraalVM sandbox is to allow the execution of untrusted guest code in a secure manner, meaning untrusted guest code should not be able to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the host code and its environment.The GraalVM sandbox differs from Security Managers in the following aspects:  Security boundary: The Java Security Manager features a flexible security boundary that depends on the actual calling context of a method. This makes “drawing the line” complex and error prone. A security-critical code block first needs to inspect the current calling stack to determine whether all frames on the stack have the authority to invoke the code. In the GraalVM sandbox, there is a straightforward, clear security boundary: the boundary between host and guest code, with guest code running on top of the Truffle framework, similar to how typical computer architectures distinguish between user mode and (privileged) kernel mode.  Isolation: With the Java Security Manager, privileged code is almost on “equal footing” as untrusted code with respect to the language and runtime:  Shared language: With the Java Security Manager, untrusted code is written in the same language as privileged code, with the advantage of straightforward interoperability between the two. In contrast, the GraalVM sandbox a guest application written in a Truffle language needs to pass an explicit boundary to host code written in Java.  Shared runtime: With the Java Security Manager, untrusted code executes in the same JVM environment as trusted code, sharing JDK classes and runtime services such as the garbage collector or the compiler. In the GraalVM sandbox, untrusted code runs in dedicated VM instances (GraalVM isolates), separating services and JDK classes of host and guest by design.  Resource limits: The Java Security Manager cannot restrict the usage of computational resources such as CPU time or memory, allowing untrusted code to DoS the JVM. The GraalVM sandbox offers controls to set limits on several computational resources (CPU time, memory, threads, processes), guest code may consume to address availability concerns.  Configuration: Crafting a Java Security Manager policy was often found to be a complex and error-prone task, requiring a subject matter expert that knows exactly which parts of the program require what level of access. Configuring the GraalVM sandbox provides security profiles that focus on common sandboxing use cases and threat models.Reporting vulnerabilitiesIf you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please submit a report to secalert_us@oracle.com preferably with a proof of concept.Please refer to Reporting Vulnerabilities for additional information including our public encryption key for secure email.We ask that you do not contact project contributors directly or through other channels about a report.Related Documentation  Polyglot Sandboxing  Security Considerations in Native Image",

Running Ruby code from another language  Loading code written in foreign languages  Exporting Ruby objects to foreign languages  Importing foreign objects to Ruby  Using Ruby objects from a foreign language  Using foreign objects from Ruby  Accessing Java objects  Threading and interop  Embedded configurationInstalling Other LanguagesTo use other GraalVM languages, you need the JVM Standalone.The Native Standalone does not support installing extra languages.Note that ruby, llvm and host Java interop are available without installing anything extra.Then you can install other languages with truffleruby-polyglot-get $LANGUAGE, for instance:truffleruby-polyglot-get jstruffleruby-polyglot-get pythontruffleruby-polyglot-get wasmtruffleruby-polyglot-get java # for Java on Truffle (aka Espresso)In TruffleRuby versions before 23.1 this was done through installing GraalVM (e.g. via truffleruby+graalvm) and using gu install $LANGUAGE.Running Ruby Code from Another LanguageWhen you eval Ruby code from the Context API in another language and mark the Source as interactive, the same interactive top-level binding is used each time.This means that if you set a local variable in one eval, you will be able to use it from the next.The semantics are the same as the Ruby semantics of calling INTERACTIVE_BINDING.eval(code) for every Context.eval() call with an interactive Source.This is similar to most REPL semantics.Loading Code Written in Foreign LanguagesNote the ruby command line needs to be passed --polyglot to enable access to foreign languages.Polyglot.eval(id, string) executes code in a foreign language identified by its ID.Polyglot.eval_file(id, path) executes code in a foreign language from a file, identified by its language ID.Polyglot.eval_file(path) executes code in a foreign language from a file, automatically determining the language.Exporting Ruby Objects to Foreign LanguagesPolyglot.export(name, value) exports a value with a given name.Polyglot.export_method(name) exports a method, defined in the top-level object.Importing Foreign Objects to RubyPolyglot.import(name) imports and returns a value with a given name.Polyglot.import_method(name) imports a value, which should be IS_EXECUTABLE, with a given name, and defines it in the top-level object.Using Ruby Objects from a Foreign LanguageUsing JavaScript as an example: the left example is JavaScript, the right one is the corresponding action it takes on the Ruby object expressed in Ruby code.object[name/index] calls object[name/index] if the object has a method [], or reads an instance variable if the name starts with @, or returns a bound method with the name.object[name/index] = value calls object[name/index] = value if the object has a method []=, or sets an instance variable if the name starts with @.delete object.name calls object.delete(name).delete object[name/index] calls object.delete(name).object.length calls object.size.Object.keys(hash) gives the hash keys as strings.Object.keys(object) gives the methods of an object as functions, unless the object has a [] method, in which case it returns an empty array.object(args...) calls a Ruby Proc, Method, UnboundMethod, etc.object.name(args...) calls a method on the Ruby object.new object(args...) calls object.new(args...).&quot;length&quot; in obj returns true for a Ruby Array.object == null calls object.nil?.Notes on Creating Ruby Objects for Use in Foreign LanguagesIf you want to pass a Ruby object to another language for fields to be read and written, a good object to pass is usually a Struct, as this will have both the object.foo and object.foo = value accessors for you to use from Ruby, and they will also respond to object[&#39;foo&#39;] and object[&#39;foo&#39;] = value, which means they will work from other languages sending read and write messages.Using Foreign Objects from Rubyobject[name/index] will read a member from the foreign object.object[name/index] = value will write a value to the foreign object.object.delete(name/index) will remove a value from the foreign object.object.size will get the size or length of the foreign object.object.keys will get an array of the members of the foreign object.object.call(*args) will execute the foreign object.object.name(*args) will invoke a method called name on the foreign object.object.new(*args) will create a new object from the foreign object (as if it is some kind of class).object.respond_to?(:size) will tell you if the foreign object has a size or length.object.nil? will tell you if the foreign object represents the language’s equivalent of null or nil.object.respond_to?(:call) will tell you if a foreign object can be executed.object.respond_to?(:new) will tell you if a foreign object can be used to create a new object (if it’s a class).Polyglot.as_enumerable(object) will create a Ruby Enumerable from the foreign object, using its size or length, and reading from it.Where boolean value is expected (e.g., in if conditions) the foreign value is converted to boolean if possible or considered to be true.Rescuing Foreign ExceptionsForeign exceptions can be caught by rescue Polyglot::ForeignException =&amp;gt; e or by rescue foreign_meta_object.It is possible to rescue any exception (Ruby or foreign) with rescue Exception =&amp;gt; e.This naturally stems from the ancestors of a foreign exception:Java.type(&quot;java.lang.RuntimeException&quot;).new.class.ancestors# =&amp;gt; [Polyglot::ForeignException, Polyglot::ExceptionTrait, Polyglot::ObjectTrait, Exception, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]Accessing Java ObjectsTruffleRuby’s Java interoperability interface is similar to the interface from the Nashorn JavaScript implementation, as also implemented by GraalVM’s JavaScript implementation.It is easier to use Java interoperability in JVM mode (--jvm). Java interoperability is also supported in native mode but requires more setup.See here for more details.Java.type(&#39;name&#39;) returns a Java type, given a name such as java.lang.Integer or int[].With the type object, .new will create an instance, .foo will call the static method foo, .FOO or [:FOO] will read the static field FOO, and so on.To access methods of the java.lang.Class instance, use [:class], such as MyClass[:class].getName.You can also go from the java.lang.Class instance to the Java type by using [:static].To import a Java class in the enclosing module, use MyClass = Java.type &#39;java.lang.MyClass&#39; or Java.import &#39;java.lang.MyClass&#39;.Embedding in JavaTruffleRuby is embedded via the Polyglot API, which is part of GraalVM.You will need to use GraalVM to use this API.import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;class Embedding {    public static void main(String[] args) {        Context polyglot = Context.newBuilder().allowAllAccess(true).build();        Value array = polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;[1,2,42,4]&quot;);        int result = array.getArrayElement(2).asInt();        System.out.println(result);    }}Using Ruby Objects from Embedding JavaRuby objects are represented by the Value class when embedded in Java.Accessing Arraysboolean hasArrayElements()Value getArrayElement(long index)void setArrayElement(long index, Object value)boolean removeArrayElement(long index)long getArraySize()Accessing Methods in Objectsboolean hasMembers()boolean hasMember(String identifier)Value getMember(String identifier)Set&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;

 p context.eval(&#39;ruby&#39;, &quot;Object.new&quot;) # prints #&amp;lt;Polyglot::ForeignObject[Ruby] Object:0x131d576b&amp;gt;endThis works by automatically wrapping every object leaving its context in a proxy, which means e.g. if a method is called on a foreign object it is executed in the context to which the object belongs.",

          "title": "Profiling Command Line Tools",
          "content": "Profiling Command Line ToolsGraalVM profiling command line tools help you optimize your code through analysis of CPU and memory usage.Most applications spend 80% of their runtime in 20% of the code.For this reason, to optimize the code, it is essential to know where the application spends its time.In this section, we use an example application to demonstrate the three main profiling capabilities that GraalVM offers: CPU Tracer, CPU Sampler, and Memory Tracer.This example application uses a basic prime number calculator based on the Sieve of Eratosthenesalgorithm.      Copy the following code into a new file named primes.js:     class AcceptFilter {     accept(n) {         return true     } } class DivisibleByFilter {     constructor(number, next) {         this.number = number;         this.next = next;     }     accept(n) {         var filter = this;         while (filter != null) {             if (n % filter.number === 0) {                 return false;             }             filter = filter.next;         }         return true;     } } class Primes {     constructor() {         this.number = 2;         this.filter = new AcceptFilter();     }     next() {         while (!this.filter.accept(this.number)) {             this.number++;         }         this.filter = new DivisibleByFilter(this.number, this.filter);         return this.number;     } } var primes = new Primes(); var primesArray = []; for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; 5000; i++) {     primesArray.push(primes.next()); } console.log(`Computed ${primesArray.length} prime numbers. ` +             `The last 5 are ${primesArray.slice(-5)}.`);    Run js primes.js. The example application should print output as follows:     js primes.js Computed 5000 prime numbers. The last 5 are 48563,48571,48589,48593,48611.    This program takes a moment to compute. Next you will check where the time is spent.    Run js --cpusampler primes.js to enable CPU sampling. CPU Sampler should print output for the example application as follows:     js --cpusampler primes.js Computed 5000 prime numbers. The last 5 are 48563,48571,48589,48593,48611. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sampling Histogram.

You can produce a flame graph in SVG format by requesting that with the --cpusampler=flamegraph option:     js --cpusampler=flamegraph primes.js    It should produce a file called flamegraph.svg containing something like this:        You can zoom into the graph by clicking on elements.    By default, CPU sampling takes a sample every 10 milliseconds. From the result, we can see that roughly 89% of the time is spent in the DivisibleByFilter.accept function.     accept(n) {     var filter = this;     while (filter != null) {         if (n % filter.number === 0) {             return false;         }         filter = filter.next;     }     return true; }    See this blog post for more details.    Now use the CPU Tracer to collect execution counts of each statement:    Run js primes.js --cputracer --cputracer.TraceStatements --cputracer.FilterRootName=*accept to collect execution counts for all statements in methods ending with accept:     js primes.js --cputracer --cputracer.TraceStatements --cputracer.FilterRootName=accept Computed 5000 prime numbers.

Tracing histograms often provides insights into the behavior of the algorithm that needs optimization.    Run js primes.js --experimental-options --memtracer to display source code locations and counts of reported allocations. Note that the Memory Tracer tool for capturing allocations is currently an experimental feature in GraalVM. As such, --memtracer must be preceded by the --experimental-options command line option.     js primes.js --experimental-options --memtracer Computed 5000 prime numbers. The last 5 are 48563,48571,48589,48593,48611. ------------------------------------------------------------ Location Histogram with Allocation Counts. Recorded a total of 5007 allocations.

For each prime number that was computed, the program allocates one object in next and one in constructor of DivisibleByFilter. Allocations are recorded independently of whether they could get eliminated by the compiler.    The GraalVM compiler is particularly powerful in optimizing allocations and can push allocations into infrequent branches to increase execution performance. The GraalVM team plans to add information about memory optimizations to the memory tracer in the future.

A new feature release supersedes all previous releases.Critical Patch Update (CPU)Critical Patch Updates (CPU) for Oracle GraalVM and GraalVM Community Edition follow the schedule for all Oracle CPU and OpenJDK CPU releases respectively. Critical Patch Updates are released on the third Tuesday of January, April, July, and October. All active releases receive patch updates.Long-Term-Support (LTS) ReleaseOracle GraalVM for JDK 21 is the current long-term support (LTS) release and will receive free updates under the GraalVM Free Terms and Conditions (GFTC) including License for Early Adopter Versions license until one full year after the subsequent LTS release, which is JDK 25.

          "content": "GraalVM Release Candidates1.0-RC16(2019-04-23)JavaWe addressed several benchmarks that had slower performance when running with the GraalVM compiler built as a native library, also known as libgraal, a mode selected as the default in the last release candidate. We fixed an issue causing a delay when shutting down the virtual machine process at the end of the execution of an application(see #1140).Native ImageWe improved the structure of the org.graalvm.nativeimage API: classes that canonly be used during image generation are now in the packageorg.graalvm.nativeimage.hosted, to clearly separate them from the classes thatcan be used at image run time. In order to stay backwards compatible, theoriginal classes are still present, but marked as deprecated. They will bedeleted in the next release candidate, so please update to the new classes.We fixed several bugs that were reported on GitHub, including anissue with the logging framework which materialized as an error that no instances of java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter are allowed in the image heap.As a result, native images work now correctly with Helidon, a Javaframework designed for writing microservices which recently announced theirsupport for GraalVM native images:Helidon flies faster with GraalVM.RubyA complete changelog for the Ruby component is available on GitHub. The highlights include:  Rounding modes have been implemented or improved for Float, Rational, BigDecimal classes (see #1509).  Added a pure-Ruby implementation of Foreign Function Interface (FFI) which passes almost all Ruby FFI specs (see #1529).  The KeyError raised from ENV#fetch and Hash#fetch now matches MRI’s message formatting (see #1633).JavaScriptA complete changelog for the JavaScript component is available on GitHub. The highlights include:  Loading JavaScript source code from URLs is now guarded by thejs.load-from-url command line option and prohibited by default.RA complete changelog for the R component is available on GitHub. The highlights include:  Allow parsing any letter in identifiersincluding, e.g., Japanese, with lexer starting from 1.0-RC16, which matchesGNU-R behavior.Python  Improved startup time of the graalpython native launcher.LLVM Runtime  The lli launcher now starts with the locale set to C.1.0-RC15(2019-04-05)JavaBy default,libgraal is nowused when running the java launcher or when using the --jvm mode for thelanguage launchers. The libgraal library is a version of the GraalVM compilerpre-compiled by native-image. In addition to improving startup time, libgraalcompletely prevents the GraalVM compiler from interfering with the heap usage andprofiles of application code. It has execution properties similar to othernative HotSpot compilers such as C1 and C2.JavaScript  Enabled Polyglot builtin based on Context.Builder.allowPolyglotAccess().  Added rest and spread properties support for foreign objects. For example, this spread syntax is now supported:    var arr1 = [0, 1, 2];var arr2 = [3, 4, 5];arr1 = [...arr1, ...arr2]; // arr1 is now [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  To see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project changelog.RNew Features  Implemented gzcon builtin for URL connections.Changes  Truffle interoperability API converts double values to int values if theyfit in the integer range.Bug Fixes  R incorrectly allowed Java interoperability when not started with --jvm.Starting from 1.0-RC15, --jvm flag is again necessary to enable interoperability with Java.A complete project changelog  is available on GitHub.RubyAn extensive list of changes is available on GitHub.Here is a short list of the most notable ones:Changes  Our experimental JRuby-compatible Java interop has been removed – use Polyglot and Java instead.  Process.clock_getres has been implemented.  debug, profile, profiler, which were already marked as unsupported, have been removed.Bug Fixes  autoload :C, &quot;path&quot;; require &quot;path&quot; now correctly triggers the autoload.  The shell standard library can now be require-d.Compatibility  Improved compatibility with MRI’s Float#to_s formatting #1626.  Added support for the base keyword argument to Dir.{[], glob}.PythonChanges  Migrated to the new Truffle libraries for interoperability support.  Added support for importing Java classes from the java namespace using normal Python import syntax, e.g., from java.util import ArrayList.  Implemented PEP 487 and PEP 560 to make the typing module work.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.LLVM Interpreter  Added  a preliminary support for bitcode produced by LLVM 8.Native ImageBased on the feedback and bug reports, we improved the agent that traces reflectionand JNI usage on the JavaHotSpot VM. We also changed the implementation languageof the agent from C to Java. The agent is now a Native Image itself.The native-image-maven-plugin now supports multiline buildArgs andboolean parameter skip (skip image building if true).API changes for GraalVM integrators (SDK + Truffle)This version of GraalVM includes a major revision of the TruffleInteroperabilityAPIs.Most existing APIs for Truffle Interoperability were deprecated. Thecompatibility layer may cause significant performance reduction forinteroperability calls. Please see the Interop MigrationGuidefor an overview and individual @deprecated javadoc tags for guidance.We added Truffle Library API that allows language implementations to usepolymorphic dispatch for receiver types with support for implementation specificcaching/profiling with support for uncached dispatch. Please see the TruffleLibraryTutorialfor further details.The numerous changes were introduced to the GraalVM SDK Polyglot API as well:  Renamed Graal SDK to GraalVM SDK.  Experimental options now require --experimental-options on the command line tobe passed to the GraalVM language launchers, orContext.Builder#allowExperimentalOptions andEngine.Builder#allowExperimentalOptions to be set in other scenarios.For example, to diagnose the memory allocations of a JavaScript application with --memtracer profiling tool,you should prepend --experimental-options option:js --experimental-options --memtracer program.js.  Added a possibility to set an encoding in Source builder.  Added a new API for target type mappings using the new HostAccess API.We summarized all Truffle and SDK changes between GraalVM versions in separate changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsChrome Inspector  Object Preview feature added for GraalVM implementation of JavaScript.  Implemented a Custom Preview experimental feature for all languages supported by GraalVM.Ideal Graph Visualizer (IGV)Starting with 1.0-RC15 version of GraalVM, Ideal Graph Visualizer will beprovided as standalone download from Oracle Technology Network Downloads page. It is not part of GraalVM Community or Enterprise editions.1.0-RC14(2019-03-18)Introducing --vm.&amp;lt;option&amp;gt;We introduced a uniform --vm.&amp;lt;option&amp;gt; which allows to pass options in a uniform way, without knowing which VM mode (--jvm, or --native) will be used. It replaces  --jvm.&amp;lt;option&amp;gt; and --native.&amp;lt;option&amp;gt; command line options, e.g., the option to configure the maximum amount of memory used for the heap --jvm.Xmx=5G becomes --vm.Xmx=5G.This applies to all languages.JavalibgraalThis is the first release to include a prebuilt libgraal shared library. This shared library is produced by the native-image and contains a pre-compiled version of the GraalVM compiler. In addition to improving startup, libgraal completely avoids interfering with the heap usage and profiling of the application code. That is, it has execution properties similar to other native HotSpot compilers such as C1 and C2. To try it out, add -XX:+UseJVMCINativeLibrary to your java command line. Note that this is still a work in progress and we are focusing on improving its stability and ensuring it does not compromise peak performance.Default Failure BehaviorThe default behavior has changed for a failure (i.e., uncaught exception) duringthe compilation. These are now silently ignored and nothing is printed to theconsole. To get the old behavior of a message being printed to the console andfor collecting diagnostics about the failure, you now need to specify-Dgraal.CompilationFailureAction=Diagnose option.Native ImagesNew FeaturesWe introduced a tracing agent for the Java HotSpot VM that records usages of reflection and JNI that can then be converted to configuration files for the native image generator. This simplifies the process of getting new applications working as native images. For details, see the documentation.We improved support for the java.util.logging API. See the GitHub docs for details.The javax.script.ScriptEngine API is now supported. Please note that the Nashorn JavaScript engine does not work in native images and is therefore always excluded. However, Truffle based language implementations such as the GraalVM JavaScript engine are available when, e.g., the native image is built with the option --language:js.Implemented the Class.getSimpleName method for the native images (see 1020).Bugfixes      Fixed an NPE during native image generation at accessing annotations metadata on the classes opened for reflection (see 1048).        Fixed createTempFile() providing non-default filesystem and failing (see 1035).        Fixed a segfault due to incorrect socket address length value (see 1025).  JavaScriptHTML-like CommentsWe added support for HTML-like comments.var s = &quot;Introducing html-like comments&quot;;alert(s);&amp;lt;!-- this is a comment --&amp;gt;Changes  Renamed the option js.experimental-array-prototype to js.experimental-foreign-object-prototype.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.RThe GraalVM implementation of R in this release comes with various bug fixes and improvements.Error PropagationAccording to the R semantics, errors are handled immediately at the point where they are raised. However, in language embedding or polyglot scenarios, it is more useful to have the errors propagate out of the R scope, so that they can be handled correctly. We changed the behavior of FastR in this regard so that now R errors are propagated. Note that this only happens if this is possible without causing unexpected side effect in R code,i.e., if there are no options(error = ...) or on.exit(...) handlers on the stack.Experimental OptionsAll specific options (NOT those GNU-R compatible like --save) are experimental except for --R.PrintErrorStacktracesToFile, which is an option that enables logging of FastR internal errors for bug reporting purposes. Experimental options can be unlocked using --experimental-options or with ContextBuilder#allowExperimentalOptions.To see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project changelog.RubyThis version of GraalVM features new methods implementations and other updates for Ruby implementation.New Features  Implemented Dir.children and Dir#children, String#delete_prefix, #delete_suffix and related methods.Changes  -Xlog= has been removed. Use --log.level= instead.  -J flag has been removed. Use --vm.* instead.  -J-cp lib.jar and similar have been removed. You should use --vm.cp=lib.jar or --vm.classpath=lib.jar instead.  The -X option now works as in MRI.An extensive list of changes is available on GitHub.PythonPython 3.7.0The standard library was updated to Python 3.7.0 from 3.6.5.Changes  Defined a subset of the graalpython launcher options as “stable”. All other options are subject to change and need to be unlocked explicitly on the command line.  Added the support for  -I flag to ignore the user environment and not add the working directory to sys.path.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.LLVM Runtime  Various bug fixes.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)New Features  Added Context.Builder#allowExperimentalOptions to control whether experimental options can be passed to a Context.  Added Engine.Builder#allowExperimentalOptions to control whether experimental instrument and engine options can be passed.  The @Option annotation can now specify the stability of an option.  Added engine bound TruffleLogger for instruments. The engine bound logger can be used by threads executing without any context.Changes  Multiple deprecated elements were removed from  the Truffle language implementation framework, i.e., TruffleException.isTimeout, EventBinding.getFilter etc..We summarized GraalVM Truffle and GraalVM SDK changes between GraalVM versions in the separate changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelog1.0-RC13(2019-03-05)ToolsIdeal Graph VisualizerWith GraalVM 1.0-RC13 release, there has been a significant change to theIdeal Graph Visualizer developer tool. The default behavior of the Dgraal.Dumpoption has changed in that IGV dumps are now written to the local file system by default.To get the old behavior of dumping straight to an IGV instance listening on 127.0.0.1:4445,you need to add -Dgraal.PrintGraph=Network option.If a network connection cannot be opened, dumping falls back to file system dumping.Graal VisualVMAnother developer tool, Graal VisualVM, now allows Heap monitoring of native-image processes.This functionality is available with Oracle GraalVM.R  R specific command line options are now passed as –R.PrintErrorStackTracesToFile=true instead of using JVM properties (–jvm.R:+PrintErrorStackTracesToFile). You can view available options with --help:languages.  Optional post installation script, configure_fastr, also regenerates etc/Renviron and etc/ldpaths files according to the target system.  R vectors are not writeable from other languages, because this would violate the R language semantics.A list of changes to GraalVM implementation of R is available on GitHub.JavaScript  Node.js updated from 10.15.0 to version 10.15.2.  Made JavaScript and Java interoperability available in native images. Note that you have to configure the accessible classes and methods at native image build time.  Node.js Worker class should be used instead of deprecated experimental Java.Worker API now.  A deprecated NashornJavaInterop mode was removed.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.LLVM Runtime  Added the support for embedded bitcode in Mach-O files. We support bitcode in the __bitcode section of Mach-O object files, as well as bitcode files in an embedded xar archive in the __bundle section of executables or dylibs. For example, on OS X, you can compile your code with clang -fembed-bitcode -flto hello.c -o hello, creating a native executable with embedded bitcode. You can then run it natively (./hello) or with GraalVM ($JAVA_HOME/bin/lli ./hello).The full project changelog is available on GitHub.RubyThis release of GraalVM is rich in performance and compatibility improvements,multiple changes and bug fixes for Ruby implementation.An extensive list of all updates is available on  Github.  Here is a short list of most notable ones:New features:  Host interoperability with Java now works on SubstrateVM too.Changes:  -Xoptions has been deprecated and will be removed. Use --help:languages instead.  -Xlog= has been deprecated and will be removed. Use --log.level= instead.  -J has been deprecated and will be removed. Use --jvm. instead.  -J-cp lib.jar and so on have been deprecated and will be removed. Use--jvm.cp=lib.jar or --jvm.classpath=lib.jar instead.  -J-cmd, --jvm.cmd, JAVA_HOME, JAVACMD, and JAVA_OPTS do not work in any releasedconfiguration of TruffleRuby, so have been removed.  -Xoption=value has been deprecated and will be removed. Use --option=value instead.  TracePoint.trace and TracePoint#inspect have been implemented.Compatibility:  Improved the exception when an -S file is not found.  Removed the message from exceptions raised by bare raise to better match MRI #1487.  TracePoint now handles the :class event.Note that GraalVM 1.0-RC13 implementation of Ruby is built on Ruby 2.4.4, and itis still vulnerable to CVE-2018-16395. This will be fixed in the next release.PythonNew feature:  Allow installation of NumPy in a venv. Just run e.g., bin/graalpython -m venv numpy_env; source numpy_env/bin/activate; graalpython -m ginstall install numpy. Note that not all NumPy features work at the moment.To see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project changelog.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)  Added Debugger.getSessionCount() to return the number of active debugger sessions.  TruffleLanguage class now can register additional services. This change also deprecates the automatic registration of the language class as a service.  OptionCategory.DEBUG has been renamed to OptionCategory.INTERNAL for clarity.  Added static member to class objects that provides access to the class’s static members.  OptionStabilityhas been added for specifying the stability of an option.All GraalVM SDK and Truffle changes between GraalVM versions are summarized in the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelog1.0-RC12(2019-02-04)Native Image GenerationNative images now check the remaining available stack size on every method call,and throw a StackOverflowError on stack overflows.We continued the work on the support of incomplete classpaths. There were no big changes,but only small bug fixes based on users feedback. The support for incomplete classpathsnow allows to run the native image generator with bytecode verification,i.e., the option --no-verify is no longer passed to the Java HotSpot VMwhen running the native image generator.RAn extensive list of changes to GraalVM implementation of R is available on GitHub. Here is a short list of most notable ones:  FastR now uses the R base function print to implement TruffleLanguage#toString, so that tools and debuggers (like the Chrome Dev Tools console) format values (e.g., data.frame objects) in a familiar, R-like, way.  GraalVM implementation of R provides GNU-R compatible parseData for expressions parsed via parse(...,keep.source=T), which enables packages that use this functionality (like lambda.r and plumber) to work.  Added a dummy implementation of the ALTREP framework to avoid linking problems.JavaScript  Updated Node.js from 10.9.0 to version 10.15.0.  A new option js.experimental-array-prototype added to set prototype of array-like non-JS objects (like ProxyArray or Java List) to Array.prototype. It makes it possible to use functions like map or forEach on these objects directly.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.LLVM Runtime  In order to streamline the polyglot APIs in LLVM Runtime, we deprecated the truffle_* builtin functions. We also broke binary compatibility to bitcode compiled with polyglot.h from version 1.0.0-RC2 (or older).  Read-only globals are now placed in read-only memory. This was necessary to accommodate some changes in mac OS Mojave’s libc that raise errors when format strings are placed in the writable memory.The project changelog is available on GitHub.RubyThis version came with the compatibility improvements:  Change to a new system for handling Ruby objects in C extensions which greatly increases compatibility with MRI.  Support for BigDecimal#to_r was implemented (See #1521).A complete project changelog is available on GitHub.PythonTo see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project changelog.  Added support for the __class__ variable in the class scope.  Initial support of the venv standard-library tool, the built-in _bz2 module and the pandas package was started up.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)GraalVM SDK and Truffle changes between GraalVM versions are summarized in the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsGraal VisualVM  Added the ability to create native image heap dump directly from Graal VisualVM interface.  Improved heap dump support in the native image.1.0-RC11(2019-01-14)Native Image GenerationWe improved the handling of incomplete classpaths, i.e., code that references classes that are not provided on the classpath. The approach we took for RC10 caused problems in corner cases that would have been difficult to fix, therefore we implemented a different approach. Thanks to everyone who tried our initial approach and reported problems on GitHub. We attempted to verify that all reported problems are solved with the new approach.JavaScript  Graal.js only supports ECMAScript 5 (ES5) and newer, and enforces that rule.  Added support for sharing Java objects using the experimental Node.js Worker Threads API.  Added support for ScriptEngine GLOBAL_SCOPE bindings.  Added options to enable/disable several extension features e.g., print() or load().  Added options to disable features for security reasons e.g., eval().More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.LLVM RuntimeGraalVM now reports source filenames and line numbers for LLVM functions in stack traces if the bitcode is compiled with debug information, even if the original source is not available.Find a complete changelog on GitHub.RubyA complete project changelog is available on GitHub. Here is a short list of most notable changes:  Allowed signal 0 to be used with Process.kill (see #1474).  Implemented Dir.each_child.  Added missing support for the close_others option to exec and spawn.  Implemented the missing MatchData#named_captures method (see #1512).  Process::CLOCK_ constants have been given the same value as in standard Ruby.  All core files now make use of frozen String literals, reducing the number of String allocations for core methods.PythonThe changelog is available on GitHub.  Added the ginstall custom module to install known packages such as NumPy and setup tools using graalpython -m ginstall.  Added support for the yield from syntax.  Added more built-in methods to the time module.  Added support for the standard zipfile module.  Added the built-in _cvs module.  Various bug fixes and performance improvements.  Removed the exposure of internal languages through polyglot.eval.R  The R version was upgraded to R-3.5.1.  R does not print or log any details for internal errors unless it is run with  --jvm.DR:+PrintErrorStacktracesToFile.  Newly implemented R native API functions:  Rf_duplicated, Rf_setVar, norm_rand, exp_rand.  Numerous bug fixes.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)Please refer to the project changelogs for a list of APIs changes:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsGraal VisualVM  Added CPU monitoring of native-image processes.  Improved the search feature in text views - thread dumps, OQL console results, etc..  Heap viewer is now displaying JVM arguments, has improved performance and memory management.1.0-RC10(2018-12-05)Bug fixes and performance improvements across all GraalVM components.Native Image GenerationAdded a new option --allow-incomplete-classpath with GraalVM 1.0-rc10. By default (without specifying this option), classes that are reachable, but missing on the class path, are reported at native image generation time. When specifying this new option, missing classes are only reported at run time. The option provides support for, e.g., libraries that probe the existence of classes, catch the class loading error, and then fall back to a different behavior. This should result in more applications being able to compile to a GraalVM native image.JavaScriptThe project changelog is available on GitHub.  Added the ability to construct the Java classpath programmatically. If you know at runtime where the classes and jar files are located – you can add them to the classpath and use Java code from them.  Compatibility: added support for several proposals which might become parts of ECMAScript 2019: Array.prototype.{flat,flatMap}, well-formed JSON.stringify, globalThis.  Compatibility: moved several non-standard builtins behind flags (see the  changelog).LLVM Runtime  Improved the debugging experience: internal functions (originating from the GraalVM LLVM interpreter implementation) are now hidden in the stack traces by default and can be debugged with --inspect.Internal; and unhandled exceptions are now output to stderr instead of stdout.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.RubyGraalVM 1.0-rc10 implementation of Ruby comes with several new features and multiple bug fixeswhich can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.  Compatibility: implemented the following API and added libraries:          The nkf and kconv standard libraries were added.      Queue and SizedQueue, #close and #closed?, have been implemented.      Kernel#clone(freeze) has been implemented.      Warning.warn has been implemented.      Thread.report_on_exception has been implemented.        Compatibility: ArgumentError messages now better match MRI.Python  Several users-facing improvements were made to the embedding interfaces: getting/setting the current working directory in Python now uses the appropriate Truffle APIs, Python will report side effects in the KEY_INFO message, and the KEYS message now responds with attributes and methods (not with dict keys).  The interactive help() builtin now works, including asking about language and syntax.A complete project changelog is available on GitHub.RMade important steps for compatibility with the R ecosystem:  Improved the support for popular packages: Rcpp modules, dplyr now mostly works,and FastR provides its own version of data.table (work in progress).  A new builtin function install.fastr.packages(pkgs) can be used to install FastR-specific versions of the rJava and data.table packages.  Fixed linking problems on MacOS when installing R packages and using Fortran code.The full changelogis available on GitHub.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)To see the list of changes to the APIs please refer to the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsGraal VisualVMSeveral quality of life improvements:  Added the display of system properties for SVM heap dumps.  Added support for the fields histogram and merged references for guest languages: JavaScript, Ruby, and so on.  Improved CPU Sampler accuracy.Ideal Graph Visualizer  The tool understands mx project structure now, e.g., the GraalVM compiler project when opening sources.  Improved performance when laying out large graphs.1.0-RC9(2018-11-05)GraalVM for Java Developers (GraalVM + compiler)  Updated based JDK to 8u192. You can find the JDK release notes at the Oracle Technology Network website.RubyGraalVM 1.0-rc9 implementation of Ruby features security updates and multiple bug fixeswhich can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.  Here is a short list of most notable changes:  LLVM for Oracle Linux 7 can now be installed without building from source.  The supported version of LLVM for Oracle Linux has been updated from 3.8 to 4.0.  mysql2 is now patched to avoid a bug in passing NULL to rb_scan_args, and now passes the majority of its test suite.  The post-install script now automatically detects if recompiling the OpenSSL C extension is needed. The post-install script should always be run in TravisCI as well, see the documentation.  Detect when the system libssl is incompatible more accurately and add instructions on how to recompile the extension.Python  Added the support help in the builtin Python shell.  Added readline to enable history and autocompletion in the Python shell.  Add support for the -q, -E, -s, and -S Python launcher flags.  Improved support for string and bytes regular expressions using our TRegex engine.  Started the initial support for the binascii module.A complete project changelog is available on GitHub.R  Various improvements in handling of foreign objects in R.  Added missing R builtins and C API: eapply builtin and rapply builtin.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.JavaScriptA complete changelog is available on GitHub.LLVM RuntimeThe project changelog is available on GitHub.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)  Added SourceElement.ROOT and StepConfig.suspendAnchors() to tune debugger stepping.  Added Context.Builder.logHandler and Engine.Builder.logHandler methods to install a logging handler writing into a given OutputStream.  Primitives, host and Proxy values can now be shared between multiple context and engine instances. They no longer throw an IllegalArgumentException when shared.The major GraalVM SDK and Truffle changes between GraalVM versions are summarized in the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsGraal VisualVM  Improved Python heapwalker by fixing class names and adding support for PString.  Fixed handling Page Up/Down in ProfilerTreeTable. See GH-109 for details.1.0-RC8(2018-10-19)GraalVM for Java Developers (GraalVM + compiler)  Added the support for Intel bit manipulation instructions. For more details, see #666.  Virtualize unsafe compare and swap calls on non-escaping objects. See #636.Maven Artifacts  The com.oracle.truffle group ID was renamed to org.graalvm.truffle.  The graal-sdk, launcher-common and polyglot-tck artifacts were moved from the org.graalvm group ID to org.graalvm.sdk.  New artifacts that are now available:          org.graalvm.compiler:compiler      org.graalvm.js:js      org.graalvm.js:js-launcher      org.graalvm.js:js-scriptengine      org.graalvm.regex:regex      org.graalvm.tools:chromeinspector      org.graalvm.tools:profiler      org.graalvm.truffle:truffle-nfi      com.oracle.substratevm:library-support      com.oracle.substratevm:objectfile      com.oracle.substratevm:pointsto      com.oracle.substratevm:svm-driver      com.oracle.substratevm:svm        The artifacts that are now modular JARs:          truffle-api      graal-sdk      js      js-scriptengine      compiler        The compiler artifact provides the jdk.internal.vm.compiler module and can be used to upgrade that module in JDK 11. Unlike the module present in the JDK, this version contains the optimizing Truffle runtime.Native Image Generation  The native image generator now has automatic support for services loaded using ServiceLoader.All service implementation classes, listed in the META-INF directory, are available automatically as soon as the service interface is used. This eliminates the need to manually register resources and reflection support for such classes. The automatic registration can be disabled with the -H:-UseServiceLoaderFeature option.  Finished the support for isolates (starting multiple independent VM instances at run time) and compressed references (to reduce memory footprint; Enterprise Edition only). More details are in an upcoming blog article.  A new Maven plugin allows native image generation from within a Maven build.  All components necessary for native image generation (Substrate VM and the GraalVM compiler) are now available on Maven Central. The dependency for that is:      &amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;com.oracle.substratevm&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;svm&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;1.0.0-rc8&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;scope&amp;gt;provided&amp;lt;/scope&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;  JavaScript  Updated Node.js to version 10.9.0.A complete changelog is available on GitHub.LLVM RuntimeThe project changelog is available on GitHub.Ruby  Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Fedora 28, and macOS 10.14 (Mojave) now supported.

Support for https URL connections, see URL-PROTOCOLS.md for more details.JavaScript  Improved support for sharing of shapes between Contexts with the same Engine, which allows to reuse ASTs and objects across different manually created contexts.  Support for BigInteger typed TypedArrays.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.LLVM RuntimeThe full changelog is available on GitHub.  New polyglot builtin polyglot_has_member.  Removed support for implicit polyglot types for local variables as the availability of type information is not guaranteed. Explicit polyglot casts are now strictly required (polyglot_as_typed). See theInteroperability guide for more details.  Support for IR-level (textual representation of bitcode files) tracing, i.e., creating an execution log of all bitcodes that were executed, for debugging purposes.  Preliminary support for LLVM 7.RubyThe complete changelog is available on GitHub. Here is a short list of most notable changes.  Useful inspect strings have been added for more foreign objects.  Added the rbconfig/sizeof native extension for better MRI compatibility.  Support for pg 1.1. The extension now compiles successfully, but may still have issues with some datatypes.  readline can now be interrupted by the interrupt signal (Ctrl+C). This fixes Ctrl+C to work in IRB.  Fixed version check preventing TruffleRuby from working with Bundler 2.0 and later.  Removed obsoleted patches for Bundler compatibility now that Bundler 1.16.5 has built-in support for TruffleRuby.  Fixed problem with Kernel.public_send not tracking its caller properlyrb_thread_call_without_gvl() no longer holds the C-extensions lock.  Fixed caller_locations when called inside method_added.  Fixed mon_initialize when called inside initialize_copy.Python  Added support for the re.split builtin.  Enhanced the java interop builtin module with introspection utility methods.  Changes in C extension interface to reduce overhead.The changelogis available on GitHub.R  AWT based graphics devices (jpg, png, X11, …) is supported when running FastR as a native image.  eval.polyglot: the parameter source was renamed to code.  New builtin as.data.frame.polyglot.value creates R data frames from Polyglot objects (KEYS are used as column names, the values must be homogenous arrays, e.g., respond to HAS_SIZE).  Paths in eval.polyglot are resolved relative to the current working directory.  Various fixes necessary to pass dplyr tests (GitHub version of dplyr).More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.ToolsIdeal Graph Visualizer  User can navigate to Javascript (guest language) source from the graph nodes.  Ideal Graph Visualizer prompts to download plugins to support Javascript editing.  Simple scripts (written in Javascript) can be applied on graph data.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)  GraalVM SDK and Truffle license changes from GPL2 with Class Path Exception to the Universal Permissive License (UPL). Please refer to the license files for more information: GraalVM Truffle license, GraalVM SDK license.To see the list of changes to the APIs, please refer to the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelog1.0-RC6(2018-08-31)GraalVM for Java Developers (GraalVM + compiler)  New optimization to remove unnecessary allocation in some calls to Enum.values().  See calls to Enum.values() don’t optimise away as expected for the details.Native Image Generation  Delay class initialization to runtime: By default, all classes that are seen asreachable for a native image are initialized during image building, i.e., theclass initialization method is executed during image building and is not seen asa reachable method at runtime. But for some classes, it is necessary to executethe class initialization method at runtime. This is now possible using the newoption --delay-class-initialization-to-runtime=&amp;lt;comma separate list of classnames&amp;gt; or using the new API RuntimeClassInitialization class.  Direct byte buffer are no longer allowed in the image heap: We added a new verification during image generation to ensure that no direct or mapped byte buffers (MappedByteBuffer instances) are in the image heap. Such buffers have either a pointer to C memory or reference a file descriptor, i.e., native resources that are available during image generation but no longer at image runtime. Using such a buffer would lead to a segfault at runtime. We discovered this issue because Netty has a few direct buffers that are created in class initializers. It is necessary to delay the initialization of such classes to runtime.  Better automatic discovery of classes, methods, and fields accessed via reflection. When String parameters of Class.forName, Class.getMethod, Class.getField, and other similar classes can be constant folded during image generation, then these classes, methods, and fields are automatically registered for reflection usage and do not need to be registered manually on the command line. Constant String parameters are a common pattern to support, e.g., different JDK versions or different library versions where a class, method, or field is not present in all cases and therefore cannot be used directly.LLVM RuntimeThe full changelogis available on GitHub.  Support for LLVM IR-level debugging, i.e., debugging at the level of *.ll instead of *.c files.  New polyglot cast functions for primitive array types, which allows object from other languages to be used like primitive arrays.  Support for function pointer members in polyglot_as_typed, which allows objects from other languages to be used in expressions like obj-&amp;gt;func(args).RubyThe complete changelog is available on GitHub. Here is a short list of most notable changes.  TruffleRuby is now usable as a JSR 223 (javax.script) language;  A migration guide from JRuby is now included.  The embedded configuration -Xembedded can now be set set on the launcher command line.  Polyglot.export can now be used with primitives and converts strings to Java, when Polyglot.import converts them from Java.  Foreign objects optimisations such as unboxing foreign strings on to_s, to_str, and inspect.  Optimized performance and keyword rest arguments (def foo(**kwrest)).  Multiple bug fixes from user reports.PythonThe full changelog is available on GitHub.  Improved compatibility with regular expressions by including CPython’s sre module as a fallback engine (in addition to Truffle’s regular expression engine).  C extension modules can now be compiled with LLVM 5+, which was prevented by internal incompatibilities before.  Introduced lazy string concatenation to significantly speed up code patterns that repeatedly concatenated strings.  Numerous C-API improvements to extend support for scikit-learn.  Extensions and fixes in various areas: behavior of function and code objects, collections, exception handling during import, type ids, documentation and generators.  Update standard library to CPython 3.6.5.  Enable reuse of ASTs in multiple Contexts (requires the contexts to be created in the same polyglot Engine).RThe full changelogis available on GitHub.  Support for reading/writing graphical parameters via par.  Added numerous builtins to the C API, enabling support for packages like RCurl, rjson, compare, naivebayes, etc.  Added support for formulas that include ....  Various bug fixes: attributes of NULL objects, of CR/LF handling in readLine, La_chol with pivot, warnings/errors in vector coercion.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)To see the list of changes to the APIs please refer to the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelog1.0-RC5(2018-07-31)GraalVM 1.0-rc5 is the first release where we provide pre-built binaries for GraalVM Community on macOS. As always all binaries are available from the downloads page.KNOWN ISSUES  The GraalVM Community distribution for macOS currently depends on some libraries that are not installed by default on current MacOS versions.This might cause issues with UI-related functionality:    Library not loaded: /usr/X11/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib    The necessary components can be added, e.g., by installing https://www.xquartz.org. We will remove this dependency in upcoming versions of GraalVM Community for macOS.  GraalVM for Java Developers (GraalVM + compiler)  1.0-RC5 includes JVMCI changes necessary to support compiling the GraalVM compiler ahead of time and deploying as a shared library alongside libjvm.so (i.e., libgraal). Note that the implementation of libgraal itself is not a part of this release as it is still under development.Native Image Generation  Added API that allows an application to distinguish between native image building, native image runtime, and regular Java execution. For more information and documentation, look at the class  ImageInfo.JavaScript  Removed legacy NashornExtensions option, use --js.nashorn-compat instead.  Added support for Symbol.prototype.description.  Added support for String.prototype.matchAll.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.RubyThe full changelog is available in the GitHub repository, but here are some of the most notable changes.  Simpler installation on macOS: it is no longer needed to add LLVM (/usr/local/opt/llvm@4/bin) to PATH on macOS.  --log.ruby.level= can be used to set the log level from any language launcher.  String#unpack1 has been implemented.  Optimized required and optional keyword arguments.  -Dtruffleruby.log and TRUFFLERUBY_LOG have been removed - use -Dpolyglot.log.ruby.level.  The custom log levels PERFORMANCE and PATCH have been removed.Python  Generator expressions now properly evaluate their first iterator in the definition scope at definition time.  Fixes for embedders to ensure top scopes are stable and local scopes always contain TruffleObjects.  C-API improvements to support simple Cython modules.  Support recognition of Python source files with the polyglot launcher, so that now --language python is not necessary when starting Python scripts with the polyglot launcher (note that the polyglot launcher still needs to be rebuilt using bin/gu rebuild-images polyglot after installing Python).Full changelog is available on GitHub CHANGELOG.md.RSee CHANGELOG for the list of changes.LLVM RuntimeThe project changelog is available on GitHub.  Support the __builtin_debugtrap function based on LLVM’s @llvmn.debugtrap intrinsic, which can be used to drop into the debugger (e.g., Chrome Inspector).  Support “zero-length array at end of struct” pattern when accessing polyglot values as structs.  Improved performance of global variable access.  Improved support for vectorized bitcode operations generated by clang.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)  Added new execution listener API that allows for simple, efficient and fine-grained introspection of executed code.  Changed the default language context policy from SHARED to EXCLUSIVE, i.e. by default there is one exclusive language instance per polyglot or inner context. This can be configured by the language using the context policy.To see the full list of changes to the APIs please refer to the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsGraal VisualVM  Graal VisualVM was added to the GraalVM Community distribution.1.0-RC4(2018-07-13)General RemarksWhile we provide updated components for all languages for this rc4 release, only the JavaScript component received fixes from its upstream repository. All other languages are unchanged in terms of functionality.The next release, rc5, is planned for the beginning of August and will provide updates for all components.JavaScriptThe GraalVM JavaScript component has been updated to provide better compatibility with the Nashorn engine. There now is a --nashorn-compat flag to enable backwards compatibility functionality. This flag is highly discouraged for new applications, but can simplify the migration from Nashorn to GraalVM for existing code.  Access getters and setters like fields  Provide Java.extend, Java.super, JavaImporter, JSAdapter  Allow to construct Interfaces or AbstractClasses      Provide top-level package globals java, javafx, javax, com, org, edu    Provide Java.isScriptFunction, Java.isScriptObject, Java.isJavaMethod and Java.isJavaFunctionSome global functions and objects have been added for the scripting mode and can be enabled with the --scripting flag:  Provide $EXEC, $ENV, $ARG, $OPTIONS1.0-RC3(2018-06-29)GraalVM for Java Developers (GraalVM + compiler)  Updated the underlying JDK version to “1.8.0_172” from “1.8.0_171”. You can find the JDK release notes at the Oracle Technology Network website.  Fixed a rare NullPointerException during JVMCI initialization.Native Image Generation  Added support for java.lang.reflect.Proxy supporting both automatic detection and manual configuration. Please refer to the documentation for the details.  Added support for Classloader.getResource() and similar methods.  Added support for loading services through theServiceLoader.  Fixed a ClassCastException on generating native images for profile-guided-optimizations (with the --pgo-instrument command line option).JavaScript  Enabled code sharing between Contexts with the same Engine.  Added support for BigInt arithmetic expressions.  Added a flag for the Nashorn compatibility mode --js.nashorn-compat, for the details and migration from Nashorn please refer to the documentation.  Rename the flag for the V8 compatibility mode to js.v8-compat.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.RubyThe full changelog is available in the GitHub repository, but here are some of the most notable changes.  Added ability to call is_a? on foreign objects.  Fixed: Qnil/Qtrue/Qfalse/Qundef can now be used as initial value for global variables in C extensions.  Fixed: SIGPIPE is correctly caught on SubstrateVM, and the corresponding write() raises Errno::EPIPE when the read end of a pipe or socket is closed.  Fixed determining the source encoding for eval() based on the magic encoding comment.Additionally, we implemented a number of performance improvements for stat() related calls, eval(), String substitutions, reading from IO and more.PythonGraalVM Python implementation is still in the early stages, but we’re making progress towards the goal of running applications which use SciPy.  Various C-API improvements allow to run simple NumPy examples.  Implemented buffered I/O and more encodings support, which enables working with files through the standard open function without having to force unbuffered access, and enables working with files that have encodings other than utf-8.  Most math module functions are now implemented and work correctly.  The random module substitute was removed and we now run the standard library random module to be fully compatible.  Improved thread-safety in the embedded scenarios when using Python contexts from multiple threads.More details are available in the project’s changelog on GitHub.R  Added more missing R builtins and C API functions, see CHANGELOG for a complete list.  Simplified installation, the script that configures FastR for the current system  jre/languages/R/bin/configure_fastr does not require Autotools anymore.  Added configuration files to allow users to build a native image of the FastR runtime, which reduces the startup time. Run jre/languages/R/bin/install_r_native_image to build the image.  Fixed an issue with the plotting window not displaying anything after it was closed and reopened.LLVM Runtime  New builtins polyglot_from_typed and polyglot_as_typed, which can be used to dynamically attach types to polyglot objects.  Implementers of TruffleObject can now respond to the GetDynamicType message to provide a type when an object is accessed from LLVM code.More details are available in the project changelog.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)  Added support for logging in Truffle languages and instruments.  Removed deprecated ResultVerifier.getDefaultResultVerifier API.To see the list of changes to the APIs please refer to the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsGraal VisualVMWe improved memory footprint and introduced several UI improvements for cleaner more responsive experience of Graal VisualVM. In addition to that, there are the following improvements:  Added recognition of the LLVM Runtime processes.  Improved displaying logical values of guest languages’ objects.  Improved the Object Query Language (OQL) Console for inspecting memory dumps functionality — sorting, filtering, aggregation, unlimited number of results now work.Chrome inspector  Multiple inspector sessions for multiple polyglot engines can run on the same port now.1.0-RC2(2018-06-05)GraalVM for Java Developers  Updated the underlying JDK version to “1.8.0_171” from “1.8.0_161”. You can find the JDK release notes at the Oracle Technology Network website.  Improved support for the Java Microbenchmark harness. Since JMH 1.21, GraalVM is a recognized and supported JVM.  Fixed a StackOverflow exception an improved performance when recursively inlining of invokedynamic instructions.  Fixed a compiler error causing incorrect code generation while building the scalac compiler.Native Image Generation  Added support for building statically linked native images. Now you can pass --static, and if you have static libc and zlib installed, it generates a standalone executable that will not require libc for running.  Added Classpath exception to the license of SubstrateVM and the Graal compiler components to make sure all GraalVM code ending up in a native image is subject to this clause.  Fixed the handling of implicit exceptions (NullPointerExeption, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, ClassCastException, …): all exceptions now have correct stack traces and can be caught as expected. Previously, implicit exceptions were sometimes not caught by an exception handler within the same method.  Fixed a number of exceptions during the generation of native images that were reported by early adopters.JavaScript  Updated Node.js to 8.11.1 (from 8.9.4), it is not a breaking change, but it brings numerous improvements, including CVE-listed security fixes.LLVM Runtime  Added a new API for accessing Java types and instantiating foreign objects from LLVM languages.Now it is possible to easily call Java code from native programs compiled to the LLVM bitcode. The example below shows how you can access Java’s BigInteger long math operations from C.#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;polyglot.h&amp;gt;int main() {    void *bigInteger = polyglot_java_type(&quot;java.math.BigInteger&quot;);    void *(*BigInteger_valueOf)(long) = polyglot_get_member(bigInteger, &quot;valueOf&quot;);    void *bi = BigInteger_valueOf(2);    void *result = polyglot_invoke(bi, &quot;pow&quot;, 256);    char buffer[100];    polyglot_as_string(polyglot_invoke(result, &quot;toString&quot;),                       buffer,                       sizeof(buffer),                       &quot;ascii&quot;);    printf(&quot;%sn&quot;, buffer);}If we compile it to the LLVM bitcode, we can execute it with GraalVM. You can see that it computes the value of2^256 which isn’t that easy to do in C otherwise.# shelajev at shrimp.local in /tmp→ clang -c -O1 -emit-llvm -I$JAVA_HOME/jre/languages/llvm big-integer-demo.c# shelajev at shrimp.local in /tmp→ lli --jvm big-integer-demo.bc115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936A more detailed list of changes to the LLVM interpreter can be found in the full changelog.Ruby  We are now compatible with Ruby 2.4.4.  Java.import name imports Java classes as top-level constants.  Coercion of foreign numbers to Ruby numbers now works.  to_s works on all foreign objects and calls the Java toString.  to_str will try to UNBOX and then re-try to_str, in order to provoke the unboxing of foreign strings.Much more details can be found in the full changelog.RAmong the other changes, we improved the stability of GraalVM’s R implementation.  Added a /jre/languages/R/bin/configure_fastr script that allows FastR’s native build scripts to adopt to the current system, which makes installing R packages much more stable.  The fastr_errors.log file was renamed to fastr_errors_pidXYZ.log and is stored in either initial working directory, the user home directory, /tmp, or the FastR home directory (picking the first location that is writeable). Please add it to the bug reports if you submit issues.Python  Added support for the Python unittest framework.  Python now supports breaking on exceptions and unwinding to stack frames in Chrome inspector.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)Both GraalVM SDK and Truffle are offering API for developers trying to build things on top of GraalVM, language implementations, embedding GraalVM, and so on.  Enabled code sharing between guest language Contexts with the same Engine, speeding up the repeated evaluation of the code.To see the list of changes to the APIs please refer to the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsVisualVM  Fixed the issues with loading polyglot heap dumps  fixed executing of scripts in R console  improved recognition of R REPL  fixed loop to nodes  fixed memory leak in child nodes  improved appearance on MacOS  Applicability fixes  added roots histogram for classGraalVM Updater gu  The default operation mode changed from “install from local files” to “install from catalog”.  -c option for installing from the catalog, can be omitted (installing from the catalog the default), but specifying -c still works.

          "title": "Reporting Performance Problems",
          "content": "Reporting Performance ProblemsWe are interested in hearing from you if you experience lower performance with TruffleRuby than with other implementations of Ruby.Please report any performance issues you might find on GitHub.The Compatibility guide lists some features which we know are slow and are unlikely to get faster.Common Problems and WhyTruffleRuby uses extremely sophisticated techniques to optimize your Ruby program.These optimizations take time to apply, so TruffleRuby is often a lot slower than other implementations until it has had time to warm up.Also, TruffleRuby tries to find a “stable state” of your program and then automatically remove the dynamism of Ruby where it is not needed, but this then means that if the stable state is disturbed, performance lowers again until TruffleRuby can adapt to the new stable state.Another problem is that TruffleRuby is very good at removing unnecessary work, such as calculations thatare not needed or loops that contain no work.All of these issues make it hard to benchmark TruffleRuby. This is not a problem that is unique to us - it applies to many sophisticated virtual machines - but most Ruby implementations are not yet performing optimizations powerful enough to show these problems, so they may be new to some people in the Ruby community.Using Oracle GraalVMTo experiment with how fast TruffleRuby can be, use Oracle GraalVM.Using the JVM ConfigurationFor the best peak performance, use the JVM configuration, using --jvm.The default native configuration starts faster but does not quite reach the same peak performance.However, you must then use a good benchmarking tool, like benchmark-ips described below, to run the benchmark, or the slowerwarmup time will mean that you do not see TruffleRuby’s true performance in the benchmark.If you want to write simpler benchmarks that just run a while loop with a simple timer (which we would not recommend anyway), then use the default native mode so that startup and warmup time is shorter.How to Check for Basic Performance ProblemsIf you are examining the performance of TruffleRuby, we would recommend that you always run with the --engine.TraceCompilation flag.If you see compilation failures or repeated compilation of the same methods, this is an indicator that something is not working as intended and you may need to examine why, or ask us to help you do so.If you do not run with this flag, TruffleRuby will try to work around errors and you will not see that there is a problem.How to Write a Performance BenchmarkThe TruffleRuby team recommends that you use benchmark-ips to check the performance of TruffleRuby.It makes things easier for us if you report any potential performance problems using a report from benchmark-ips.A benchmark could look like this:require &#39;benchmark/ips&#39;Benchmark.ips do |x|  x.iterations = 2  x.report(&quot;adding&quot;) do    14 + 2  endendWe use the x.iterations = extension in benchmark-ips to run the warmup and measurement cycles of benchmark-ips two times, to ensure the results are stable and that enough warmup was provided (which can be tweaked with x.warmup = 5).You should see something like this:Warming up --------------------------------------              adding    20.933k i/100ms              adding     1.764M i/100msCalculating -------------------------------------              adding      2.037B (±12.7%) i/s -      9.590B in   4.965741s              adding      2.062B (±11.5%) i/s -     10.123B in   4.989398sWe want to look at the last line, which says that TruffleRuby runs 2.062 billion iterations of this block per second, with a margin of error of ±11.5%.Compare that to an implementation like Rubinius:Warming up --------------------------------------              adding    71.697k i/100ms              adding    74.983k i/100msCalculating -------------------------------------              adding      2.111M (±12.2%) i/s -     10.302M              adding      2.126M (±10.6%) i/s -     10.452MHere, TruffleRuby’s performance can be described as a thousand times faster than Rubinius.That seems like a lot - and what is actually happening here is that TruffleRuby is optimizingaway your benchmark.The effect is less pronounced with complex code that cannot be optimized away.Final Technical Note: Blackholes and Value ProfilingSome benchmarking tools for other languages have features called “blackholes.”These surround a value and make it appear to be a variable at runtime, even if it is in fact a constant, so that the optimizer does not remove it and actually performs any computations that use it.However, TruffleRuby uses extensive value profiling (caching of values and turning them into constants), so that even if you make a value appear to be a variable at its source, it is likely to be value-profiled at an intermediate stage.In general, more complex benchmarks that naturally defeat value profiling are preferable, rather than manually adding annotations to turn off important features.",

          "title": "Security Guide",
          "content": "Security GuideThis security guide provides developers and embedders with information on the security model and features of GraalVM for developers and embedders who seek to build a secure application on top of it.It assumes that readers are familiar with the GraalVM architecture.This guide does not replace but rather supplements the Java security documentation such as the Secure Coding Guidelines for Java SE with aspects unique to GraalVM.Security ModelGraalVM is a shared runtime. It accepts instructions in a higher-levelprogramming language (or an intermediate representation thereof) as input, which is executed later.Developers that implement security controls for their applications (such as access control) in code that is being run by GraalVM can rely on the correct execution of instructions.Incorrect execution of security-critical code running on top of GraalVM that allows to bypass such a security control is regarded a security vulnerability.Debug features should only be used in a trusted environment as they provide privileged access to an application, allowing to inspect and change its state and behavior.They may further open network sockets to allow debug clients to connect.Experimental features in GraalVM are not for production use and may have security limitations not covered in the Security Guide.GraalVM enables execution of untrusted code in an appropriately configured polyglot execution context (see Polyglot Sandboxing).We appreciate reports of bugs that break the security model via the processoutlined in the Reporting Vulnerabilities guide.Polyglot LanguagesFor every Polyglot language shipped with GraalVM, a launcher, e.g., interactive shell, is provided.These launchers behave in the same way and come with the same security guarantees as their “original” counterparts.Polyglot SandboxingPolyglot sandboxing can establish a security boundary between privileged host code and unprivileged guest code.For further information please refer to the Polyglot Sandboxing guide.ScriptEngine CompatibilityFor reasons of backward compatibility, certain Polyglot languages also support the Java Scripting API.For example, this allows the GraalVM Javascript runtime to be used as a drop-in replacement for Nashorn.However, to maintain compatibility, the Nashorn GraalVM JavaScript ScriptEngine interface will create a context with all privileges granted to the script and should be used with extreme caution and only for trusted code.Managed Execution of Native CodePolyglot embedding also supports LLVM intermediate representation (IR) guest code.Several native system programming languages, above all C/C++, can be compiled to LLVM IR with the LLVM compiler toolchain.Typically, these languages are not memory-safe unless using managed execution and it must be remembered that violations of memory safety are a frequent cause of security vulnerabilities.In managed mode, all access to unmanaged code including the operating system is mediated by the language runtime. In particular this means that:  In regards to temporal and spatial memory safety, memory is allocated from the Java heap. This means that memory allocations are managed objects and all accesses are performed in a memory-safe manner (no arbitrary pointer arithmetics and no unchecked out-of-bounds accesses).  Regarding type safety, it is not possible to reinterpret a data pointer into a function pointer and execute arbitrary instructions (since these are distinct pointer types for LLVM runtime).  System calls are intercepted and routed to the corresponding Truffle APIs. For example, file IO is mapped to the Truffle FileSystem API.The set of currently supported system calls is very limited – only syscalls that can safely be mapped to the Truffle API level are available. Since LLVM Runtime in managed mode always runs bitcode compiled for Linux/x86, it only needs to implement system calls for this platform.  All dependent libraries are executed in managed mode as well, removing all references to natively executed system libraries. This includes libraries that are provided by the LLVM Runtime, such as muslibc.Managed mode can be selected when creating a context (Context.create()) or when calling the bin/lli binary by specifying the --llvm.managed option. A “managed” context will adhere to any restrictions (e.g., allowIO) passed during context creation and does not need the allowNativeAccess privilege.Native ImageWith GraalVM native image, an application’s state is captured after startup and all reachable code is compiled ahead of time to be bundled as a native executable.For further information please refer to the native image security guide.Security ManagerSecurity manager has been deprecated in JEP-411.GraalVM does not support untrusted code execution in Java.GraalVM Community Edition DowngradePolyglot sandboxing is not available in GraalVM Community Edition.Managed execution of native code is not available with GraalVM Community Edition.When downgrading to GraalVM Community Edition, native code execution is only possible with the allowNativeAccess privilege.This also applies to languages implemented with Truffle that allow for native code extensions, such as Python and Ruby.Related Documentation  Polyglot Sandboxing  Security Considerations in Native Image",

          "title": "TruffleRuby Additional Functionality",
          "content": "TruffleRuby Additional FunctionalityTruffleRuby is intended to be usable as a standard Ruby implementation that runs programs developed on other implementations, but it also provides additional functionality beyond that of other implementations.See the Compatibility guide for compatibility with other Ruby implementations.Detecting If You Run on TruffleRubyYou can use the --version command-line option. TruffleRuby will report for example:truffleruby ..., like ruby ..., GraalVM CE Native [x86_64-darwin]In Ruby code, you can look at the standard RUBY_ENGINE constant, which will be &#39;truffleruby&#39;.In C code TRUFFLERUBY is defined.It is also possible to use feature-detection instead of looking at RUBY_ENGINE.You can find the version number of TruffleRuby using the standard RUBY_ENGINE_VERSION constant.TruffleRuby Methods and ClassesTruffleRuby provides these non-standard methods and classes that provide additional functionality in the TruffleRuby module:      TruffleRuby.jit? reports if the GraalVM Compiler is available and will be used.        TruffleRuby.native? reports if TruffleRuby is compiled as a native executable.        TruffleRuby.cexts? reports if TruffleRuby has the GraalVM LLVM Runtime for C extensions available.        TruffleRuby.revision reports the source control revision used to build TruffleRuby as a String. Also available as RUBY_REVISION, like CRuby 2.7+.        TruffleRuby.full_memory_barrier ensures lack of reordering of loads or stores before the barrier with loads or stores after the barrier.        TruffleRuby.graalvm_home returns the GraalVM home or nil if running outside of GraalVM (e.g., Native standalone).        TruffleRuby.synchronized(object) { } will run the block while holding an implicit lock per object instance.  Atomic References      atomic_reference = TruffleRuby::AtomicReference.new(value=nil) creates a new atomic reference with a reference to a given object.        atomic_reference.get gets the value of an atomic reference, returning the value.        atomic_reference.set(new_value) sets the value of an atomic reference and causes a memory barrier on writes involving new_value.        atomic_reference.get_and_set(new_value) sets the value of an atomic reference, returns the previous value, and causes a memory barrier on writes involving new_value.        atomic_reference.compare_and_set(expected_value, new_value) sets the value of an atomic reference, only if it currently has the expected value, returning a boolean to say whether or not it was set, and causes a memory barrier on writes involving new_value. For numeric objects it will get the current value and then check that the current value is also a numeric and that it is equal to the expected value by calling ==, then perform an atomic compare and set.        AtomicReference is marshalable.  Concurrent MapsTruffleRuby::ConcurrentMap is a key-value data structure, like a Hash and using #hash and #eql? to compare keys and identity to compare values. Unlike Hash it is unordered. All methods on TruffleRuby::ConcurrentMap are thread-safe but should have higher concurrency than a fully synchronized implementation. It is intended to be used by gems such as concurrent-ruby - please use via this gem rather than using directly.      map = TruffleRuby::ConcurrentMap.new([initial_capacity: ...], [load_factor: ...])        map[key] = new_value        map[key]        map.compute_if_absent(key) { computed_value } if the key is not found, run the block and store the result. The block is run at most once. Returns the computed value.        map.compute_if_present(key) { |current_value| computed_value } if the key is found, run the block and store the result. If the block returns nil the entry for that key is removed. The block is run at most once. Returns the final value, or nil if the block returned nil.        map.compute(key) { |current_value| computed_value } run the block, passing the current value if there is one or nil, and store the result. If the block returns nil the entry for that key is removed. Returns the computed value.        map.merge_pair(key, new_value) { |existing_value| merged_value } if key is not found or is nil, store the new value, otherwise call the block and store the result, or remove the entry if the block returns nil. Returns the final value for that entry, or nil if the block returned nil.        map.replace_pair(key, expected_value, new_value) replace the value for key but only if the existing value for it is the same as expected_value (compared by identity). Returns if the value was replaced or not.        map.replace_if_exists(key, value) replace the value for key but only if it was found. Returns value if the key exists or nil.        map.get_and_set(key, new_value) sets the value for a key and returns the previous value.        map.key?(key) returns if a key is in the map.        map.delete(key) removes a key from the map if it exists, returning the value or nil if it did not exist.        map.delete_pair(key, expected_value) removes a key but only if the existing value for it is the same as expected_value (compared by identity). Returns if the key was deleted.        map.clear removes all entries from the map.        map.size gives the number of entries in the map.        map.get_or_default(key, default_value)        map.each_pair { |key, value| ... }  FFITruffleRuby includes a Ruby-FFI backend. This should be transparent: you can just install the ffi gem as normal, and it will use TruffleRuby’s FFI backend. TruffleRuby also includes a default version of the FFI gem, so require &quot;ffi&quot; always works on TruffleRuby, even if the gem is not installed.Polyglot ProgrammingThe Polyglot and Java modules provide access to the polyglot programming functionality of GraalVM.They are described in the Polyglot Programming guide.Unsupported Additional FunctionalityYou may be able to find some other modules and methods not listed here that look interesting, such as Truffle::POSIX or Truffle::FFI.Additional modules and methods not listed in this document are designed to support the implementation of TruffleRuby and should not be used. They may be modified or made not visible to user programs in the future, and you should not use them.Extra macros, functions, and variables in TruffleRuby C extension headers beyond those provided by MRI, such as those starting with rb_tr_*, are unsupported and should not be used by any C extension.",

          "content": "Use System Properties in a Native ExecutableAssume you have compiled the following Java application using javac:public class App {    public static void main(String[] args) {        System.getProperties().list(System.out);    }}If you build a native executable using native-image -Dfoo=bar App, the system property foo will be available at executable build time. This means it is available to the code in your application that is run at build time (usually static field initializations and static initializers).Thus, if you run the resulting executable, it will not contain foo in the printed list of properties.If, on the other hand, you run the executable with app -Dfoo=bar, it will display foo in the list of properties because you specified property at executable runtime.In other words:  Pass -D&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt; as an argument to native-image to control the properties seen at build time.  Pass -D&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt; as an argument to a native executable to control the properties seen at runtime.Read System Properties at Build TimeYou can read system properties at build time and incorporate them into the resulting executable file, as shown in the following example.PrerequisiteMake sure you have installed a GraalVM JDK.The easiest way to get started is with SDKMAN!.For other installation options, visit the Downloads section.  Save the following Java code into a file named ReadProperties.java, then compile it using javac:     public class ReadProperties {     private static final String STATIC_PROPERTY_KEY = &quot;static_key&quot;;     private static final String INSTANCE_PROPERTY_KEY = &quot;instance_key&quot;;     private static final String STATIC_PROPERTY;     private final String instanceProperty;     static {         System.out.println(&quot;Getting value of static property with key: &quot; + STATIC_PROPERTY_KEY);         STATIC_PROPERTY = System.getProperty(STATIC_PROPERTY_KEY);     }         public ReadProperties() {         System.out.println(&quot;Getting value of instance property with key: &quot; + INSTANCE_PROPERTY_KEY);         instanceProperty = System.getProperty(INSTANCE_PROPERTY_KEY);     }             public void print() {         System.out.println(&quot;Value of instance property: &quot; + instanceProperty);     }              public static void main(String[] args) {         System.out.println(&quot;Value of static property: &quot; + STATIC_PROPERTY);         ReadProperties rp = new ReadProperties();         rp.print();     }  }    Build the native executable, passing a system property as a command-line argument. Then run the native executable, passing a different system property on the command line.     native-image -Dstatic_key=STATIC_VALUE ReadProperties     ./readproperties -Dinstance_key=INSTANCE_VALUE    You should see the following output:     Getting value of static property with key: static_key Value of static property: null Getting value of instance property with key: instance_key Value of instance property: INSTANCE_VALUE    This indicates that the class static initializer was not run at build time, but at runtime.    To force the class static initializer to run at build time, use the --initialize-at-build-time flag, as follows:     native-image --initialize-at-build-time=ReadProperties -Dstatic_key=STATIC_VALUE ReadProperties    In the output from the native-image tool you should see output similar to the following:     ... [1/7] Initializing...                                            (7.7s @ 0.07GB) Getting value of static property with key: static_key ...    Run the executable again, as follows:    ./readproperties -Dinstance_key=INSTANCE_VALUE    This time you should see the following output, confirming that the static initializer was run at build time, not at runtime.    Value of static property: STATIC_VALUEGetting value for instance property key: instance_keyValue of instance property: INSTANCE_VALUE  Related Documentation  Class Initialization in Native Image  Specify Class Initialization Explicitly",

VisualVM enables powerful yet easy-to-use Java tooling which includes heap analysis for the supported guest languages. The following languages and features are currently available:  Java: Heap Summary, Objects View, Threads View, OQL Console  JavaScript: Heap Summary, Objects View, Thread View  Python: Heap Summary, Objects View  Ruby: Heap Summary, Objects View, Threads View  R: Heap Summary, Objects ViewStarting VisualVM      Download the latest VisualVM from visualvm.github.io, unzip, and move it to the applications directory.        Double-click on the application icon to start.  Immediately after startup, the tool shows all locally running Java processes in the Applications area, including the VisualVM process, itself.Capture a Heap DumpTo capture a heap dump of, for example, a Ruby application for later analysis, start your application and let it run for a few seconds to warm up.Then right-click its process in VisualVM and invoke the Heap Dump action.A new heap viewer for the Ruby process opens.Note: Heap dump support must be explicitly enabled when using Native Image.Add the --enable-monitoring=heapdump,jvmstat option when invoking the native-image tool to enable the heap dump feature and allow VisualVM to detect native executables via jvmstat.This way your application will handle signals and capture a heap dump when it receives the SIGUSR1 signal.See the Generating Native Heap Dumps page for details on capturing heap dumps from a native image process.Analyzing ObjectsInitially the Summary view for the Java heap is displayed.To analyze the Ruby heap, click the leftmost (Summary) dropdown in the Heap Viewer toolbar, choose the Ruby Heap scope and select the Objects view.Now the heap viewer displays all Ruby heap objects, aggregated by their type.Expand the Proc node in the Results view to see a list of objects of this type.Each object displays its logical value as provided by the underlying implementation.Expand the objects to access their variables and references, where available.Now enable the Preview, Variables, and References details by clicking the buttons in the toolbar, and select the individual ProcType objects.Where available, the Preview view shows the corresponding source fragment, the Variables view shows variables of the object, and the References view shows objects referring to the selected object.Last, use the Presets dropdown in the Heap Viewer toolbar to switch the view from All Objects to Dominators or GC Roots.To display the heap dominators, retained sizes must be computed first, which can take a few minutes for the server.rb example.Select the Objects aggregation in the toolbar to view the individual dominators or GC roots.Analyzing ThreadsClick the leftmost dropdown in the Heap Viewer toolbar and select the Threads view for the Ruby heap.The heap viewer now displays the Ruby thread stack trace, including local objects. The stack trace can alternatively be displayed textually by clicking the HTML toolbar button.Reading JFR SnapshotsThe VisualVM tool bundled with GraalVM 19.2.x and later has the ability to read JFR snapshots – snapshots taken with JDK Flight Recorder (previously Java Flight Recorder).JFR is a tool for collecting diagnostic and profiling data about a running Java application.It is integrated into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and causes almost no performance overhead, so it can be used even in heavily loaded production environments.To install the JFR support, released as a plugin:  Run $JAVA_HOME/bin/jvisualvm to start VisualVM;  Navigate to Tools &amp;gt; Plugins &amp;gt; Available Plugins to list all available plugins, then install the VisualVM-JFR andVisualVM-JFR-Generic modules.The JFR snapshots can be opened using either the File &amp;gt; Load action, or by double-clicking the JFR Snapshots node and adding the snapshot into the JFRrepository, permanently.Please follow the documentation for your Java version to create JFR snapshots.The JFR viewer reads all JFR snapshots created from Java 7 onward, and presents the data in typical VisualVM views familiar to the tool users.These views and functionality tabs are currently available:  Overview tab - displays the basic information about the recorded process likeits main class, arguments, JVM version and configuration, and system properties.This tab also provides access to the recorded thread dumps.  Monitor tab - shows the process uptime and basic telemetry: CPU usage, Heapand Metaspace utilization, number of loaded classes, and number of live &amp;amp; startedthreads.  Threads tab - reconstructs the threads timeline based on all events recorded inthe snapshot as precisely as possible, based on the recording configuration.  Locks tab - allows the user to analyze threads synchronization.  File IO tab - presents information on read and write events to the filesystem.  Socket IO tab - presents information on read and write events to the network.  Sampler tab - shows per-thread CPU utilization and memory allocations, and aheap histogram. There is also an experimental feature, “CPU sampler,” for building a CPUsnapshot from the recorded events. It does not provide an exact performanceanalysis but still helps to understand what was going on in the recordedapplication, and where the CPU bottleneck might be.  Browser tab - provides a generic browser of all events recorded in the snapshot.  Environment tab - gives an overview of the recording machine setup and conditionslike CPU model, memory size, operating system version, CPU utilization, memoryusage, etc.  Recording tab - lists the recording settings and basic snapshot telemetry likenumber of events, total recording time, etc.Note: The support of JDK Flight Recorder is currently experimental. Some advanced features like analyzing JVM internals, showing event stack traces, or support for creating JFR snapshots from live processes are not available in this preview version and will be addressed incrementally in the following releases.",

          "title": "Why GraalVM?",
          "content": "Why GraalVM?GraalVM compiles your Java applications ahead of time into standalone binaries that start instantly, provide peak performance with no warmup, and use fewer resources.The key GraalVM benefits are:  Low Resource Usage: Java applications compiled ahead-of-time by GraalVM require less memory and CPU to run. No memory or CPU cycles are spent on just-in-time compilation. As a result, your applications need fewer resources to run and are cheaper to operate at scale.  Fast Startup: With GraalVM, you can start your Java application faster by initializing some of its elements at build time instead of run time, and instantly achieve predictable peak performance with no warmup.  Compact Packaging: Java applications compiled ahead-of-time by GraalVM are small and can be easily packaged into lightweight container images for fast and efficient deployment.  Improved Security: GraalVM reduces the attack surface of your Java application by excluding the following from the binary: unreachable code (unused classes, methods, and fields), the just-in-time compilation infrastructure, and build-time initialized code.GraalVM’s closed world assumption prevents your application from loading unknown code by disabling dynamic features such as reflection, serialization, and so on at run time, and requires an explicit include list of such classes, methods, and fields at build time.GraalVM can embed a software bill of materials (SBOM) in your binary making it easier for you to use common security scanners to check your Java application binaries for published CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).  Easily Build Cloud Native Microservices: Popular microservices frameworks such as Spring Boot, Micronaut, Helidon, and Quarkus, and cloud platforms such as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure all support GraalVM.This makes it easy for you to build cloud native Java microservices, compiled as binaries, packaged in small containers, and run on cloud platforms - OCI, AWS, GCP and Azure.  Extend your Java Application with Python and Other Languages: With GraalVM you can embed languages such as Python, JavaScript, and others to extend your Java application.  Use Existing Development and Monitoring Tools: Your existing Java application development and monitoring tools work with GraalVM application binaries.GraalVM provides build plugins for Maven and Gradle, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.GraalVM supports Java Flight Recorder (JFR), Java Management Extensions (JMX), heap dumps, VisualVM, and other monitoring tools.GraalVM works with existing Java editors/IDEs, and unit test frameworks such as JUnit.Run Java Faster on GraalVM JDKGraalVM is a full-scale JDK distribution that can make Java applications run faster with a new advanced just-in-time compiler (Graal). As a platform it uses the Java HotSpot VM, so all tools and libraries that work on OpenJDK, work the same way on GraalVM JDK. In this context, GraalVM replaces the last-tier optimizing compiler in the JVM (C2) with the Graal compiler. This compiler is the outcome of 10+ years of research at Oracle Labs and includes several new optimizations, such as advanced inlining, partial escape analysis, code duplication, and speculative optimizations. GraalVM is itself written in Java, rather than C/C++, which simplifies maintenance and helps us develop and deliver new optimizations much faster.Several companies, such as Oracle Cloud, Twitter, and Facebook are running large-scale Java applications on GraalVM JDK to increase performance, reduce resource usage, and lower deployment costs.GraalVM JDK can simply be used as a drop-in replacement for other JDKs — see how to get started.Build Native Executables of Java ApplicationsRunning applications on the JVM can come with startup and footprint costs.GraalVM includes Native Image: a technology which leverages the Graal compiler to produce native executables of Java applications, that are self-contained and thus no longer require the JVM.The image generation process employs static analysis to find all code reachable from the main Java method and then performs full ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation.At build time, it also performs snapshotting, so, at run time, the application starts much faster with pre-populated heap.The resulting native binary contains the whole program in machine code form that is ready for execution instantly at startup.Such native executables have the following features:  Instant startup due to pre-initializing the JDK and user code at build time  Reduced memory and CPU usage due to minimized code execution overhead  Small packaging due to the AOT approach and slim runtime components  Reduced attack surface due to code elimination and the AOT approachGive Native Image a try by building your first application.Work with Latest Industry Tools and PlatformsNative Image is a great deployment model for microservices and serverless Java applications. This is the reason why several major application frameworks, such as Spring Boot, Micronaut, Quarkus, and Helidon, offer Native Image support. There is an entire ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools that you can use with Native Image out of the box — view the list here.All major cloud platforms also offer support for building applications with GraalVM Native Image. You can easily build applications with GraalVM on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (and get access to Oracle GraalVM as a part of your subscription), leverage GraalVM support in Azure SDK for Java and Spring Cloud Azure, use Native Image in the AWS SDK for Java, and compile applications as native executables using Google Cloud’s Client Libraries for Java.As an example of how GraalVM can improve cloud Java deployments, take a look at Disney Streaming’s use case. While researching ways to mitigate the cold starts of their serverless Java workloads, they discovered that a function that took 3.6s to start on the JVM, started in under 100ms when compiled with GraalVM Native Image — so 36x faster! Even operating within minimal memory, such as 512 MB, a natively compiled application was still fully functional and started much faster than on the JVM.Extend Java with JavaScript, Python, and Other LanguagesWith GraalVM you can run JavaScript, Python, Ruby, WebAssembly, and other languages, in the context of Java applications. It offers the ability to expose Java data structures to those languages with fine-grained host access filters. To get started, see how you can build your first polyglot Java application, define guest language functions as Java values, and access guest languages from Java.You can also use GraalVM and the Truffle framework as a platform for your languages and tools.It will automatically derive high-performance code from your language interpreter and provide access to the rich tooling ecosystem.Find out how to implement your own language or tool.",

          "title": "Installation on Windows Platforms",
          "content": "Installation on Windows PlatformsGraalVM Community Edition is available for Windows on the x64 architecture. You can install it on Windows from an archive file (zip).Follow these steps to install GraalVM:      Navigate to the GraalVM Downloads page. Select 22 for the Java version, Windows for the operating system, and download.        Change to the directory where you want to install GraalVM, then move the .zip archive file to it.        Unzip the archive to your file system.    There can be multiple JDKs installed on the machine. The next step is to configure the runtime environment. Setting environment variables via the command line will work the same way for Windows 8, 10, and 11.          Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to resolve to the GraalVM installation directory:         setx /M JAVA_HOME &quot;C:Progra~1Java&amp;lt;graalvm&amp;gt;&quot;            Set the value of the PATH environment variable to the GraalVM bin directory:         setx /M PATH &quot;C:Progra~1Java&amp;lt;graalvm&amp;gt;bin;%PATH%&quot;        Note that the /M flag, equivalent to -m, requires elevated user privileges.              Restart Command Prompt to reload the environment variables. Then use the following command to check whether the variables were set correctly:     echo %PATH% echo %JAVA_HOME%  Alternatively, you can set up environment variables through a Windows GUI:  Go to Windows Start Menu, then Settings, then Advanced.  Click Environment Variables. In the section “System Variables” find the JAVA_HOME variable and select it.  Click Edit.  Click New.  Click Browse to find the directory to add. Confirm by clicking OK.  Restart the Command Prompt to reload the environment variables.Repeat the same for the PATH environment variable.Prerequisites for Native Image on WindowsOn Windows, Native Image requires Visual Studio and Microsoft Visual C++(MSVC).Use Visual Studio 2022 version 17.6.0 or later.Install Visual Studio Build Tools and Windows SDK      Download the Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 or later (C development environment) from visualstudio.microsoft.com.        Start the installation by opening the file you downloaded, and then click Continue:            Select the Desktop development with C++ checkbox in the main window. On the right side under Installation Details, make sure that the two requirements, Windows 11 SDK and MSVC (…) C++ x64/x86 build tools, are selected. Continue by clicking Install.      You should now be able to build with GraalVM Native Image.Checking Existing Visual Studio InstallationsIf Visual Studio is already installed on your system, follow these steps to check that the correct components are installed.      Open the Visual Studio Installer:            Under the Installed tab, click Modify and choose Individual Components:            Then scroll to the bottom and confirm that the Windows 11 SDK and Visual Studio SDK checkboxes are selected. Now you can start using Native Image.  Start Using Native ImageNative Image sets up build environments automatically if it can find an appropriate Visual Studio installation in a known location.With the GraalVM JDK on your PATH, you can therefore now run the native-image utility in a Command Prompt (cmd) or a PowerShell (pwsh).To check the native-image version, run:C:&amp;gt; native-image.cmd --versionTo build a project using the Native Build Tools Maven plugin, run:mvnw.cmd native:compileTo build a project using the Native Build Tools Gradle plugin, run:gradlew.bat nativeCompileThis guide was written for Windows 11, but should be valid for Windows 8 and 10.",
