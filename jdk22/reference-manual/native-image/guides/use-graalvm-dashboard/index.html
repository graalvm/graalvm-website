<p>GraalVM Dashboard was removed in GraalVM for JDK 22.
Instead, use the <a href="/jdk22/reference-manual/native-image/optimizations-and-performance/PGO/build-reports/">Native Image Build Report tool</a>. 
Build reports provide useful visualizations and comprehensive insights into different metrics of your native executable and the build process itself.</p>
